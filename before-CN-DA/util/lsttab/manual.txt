  Manual for Program LSTTAB
  =========================

  The program uses the list file generated by PLOTC4 to extract
  data from an ENDF file and from the C4 file containing EXFOR
  data in computational format (generated by X4TOC4) and writes
  them in PLOTTAB "curves" and "points" format, respectively.

  Instructions:
  Input parameters can be entered interactively in response to
  the prompts on the screen:
  1  PLOTC4 list file.
  2  EXFOR source file in computational C4 format.
  3a ENDF source file.
  3b Label to appear on the plot for this source file.
     NOTE: Up to MXEN files can be specified.
  4  Resolution broadening fraction (0<Ep6<0.1)
  5a Index number from the PLOTC4 list file to be processed.
  5b Scaling factor for this set (default scaling factor=1,
     an arbitrary factor may be assigned, for example to
     differentiate between data sets on the same plot).
     NOTE: Several pairs of entries may be chosen, terminated
     by blank.

  Files used:
   Name Unit   Description
   FLLS LLS=1  PLOTC4 list file.
   FLEF LEF=2  ENDF source file.
   FLC4 LC4=3  EXFOR source file in computational format.
   FLPN LPN=7  Selected experimental points (PLOTTAB points fmt).
   FLCU LCU=8  Selected curve from ENDF file (PLOTTAB points fmt).
