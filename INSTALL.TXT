EMPIRE 3.1 has been tested successfully on Linux (Ubuntu, Redhat) and Mac OS X (10.5 and higher).  
It can also be run on Windows with either the MinGW and Cygwin environments.  EMPIRE is provided 
as a source code that must be compiled to function.

Required:
    Fortran90 compiler: gfortran (version XXX or higher) or ifort (version ...)
    C/C++ compiler
    Python, Tcl/Tk

Recommended:
    ActiveTcl extension to Tcl/Tk



Graphical Installation 
======================



Non-graphical Installation
==========================

1)  Download the following files from http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/empire-3.1/ and place 
    them in the same temporary directory (e.g. ~/empire-tmp/):

        setup.sh
        EMPIRE-3.1-RIVOLI.tgz
        level-densities-hfb.tgz [Optional]
        C4-latest.tgz [Optional]
        ActiveTcl8.4.7.0-linux-ix86-108887.tar.gz [Optional - for Linux]
        ActiveTcl8.4.19.5.19.294317-macosx-universal-threaded.dmg [Optional - for Mac OSX]

2)  Run the setup.sh script

        $ sh install.sh

    Then follow the on screen instructions.  The installation script will detect whether 
    the optional files are present in your temporary directory and attempt to install them.
    On the Mac, you may need to install the ActiveTcl package manually.  If so, follow the 
    manual instructions below.


To run empire you may create a working subdirectory of your empire root 
[e.g. ~/empire-3.1-rivoli/Fe56new], change to it and launch the EMPIRE GUI (Xrun.tcl):

    $ mkdir Fe56new
    $ cd Fe56new
    $ ../scripts/Xrun.tcl & 



Manual Installation
===================

1)  Download the files listed above in the non-graphical installation.

2)  Unpack EMPIRE-3.1-RIVOLI.tgz

        $ tar xzf EMPIRE-3.1-RIVOLI.tgz

    This will unpack to a directory called EMPIRE-3.1-RIVOLI/.
    Once the distribution is unpacked, you may rename the this level directory.

3)  Build the package

        $ cd EMPIRE-3.1-RIVOLI
        $ make

4)  [Optional] Unpack the HFB level densities
    Untar the HFB level-density distribution file level-densities-hfb.tgz to the 
       corresponding subdirectory RIPL/densities/total/level-densities-hfb 
       (if you plan to use RIPL HFB level densities)

5)  [Optional] Unpack the EXFOR data
    Unzip the distribution file C4-latest.zip to the corresponding subdirectory 
       EXFOR/ to get the automatic retrieval and plotting of EXFOR experiemntal 
       data.  One is available on the EMPIRE download site and from the IAEA at
       http://www-nds.iaea.org/x4toc4-master/.   Once you unzip it, run the 
       parseC4.py script.

6)  [Optional] Install ActiveTcl

7)  [Optional] Add $EMPIREXXX to your .bashrc or .cshrc
