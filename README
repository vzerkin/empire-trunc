                         version 2.16
                         (Montenotte)

                         July 10, 2001

Installation:

On UNIX systems just run Install inside the main empire directory.

Running:

Use lrun.tcl script in the empire/work directory. This needs Tcl/Tk
and bash shell installed. Otherwise one can use scripts also provided in the
empire/work directory. Please refer to empire-2.13 write-up for more
details.

Please note that:

1. EXFOR library is not provided with this distribution. You should copy
   or link EXFOR/subent directory from empire-2.13 or later to 
   empire/EXFOR/subent, e.g., being in empire/EXFOR type
   ln -s (path to empire-2.13)/empire/EXFOR/subent subent
   Do NOT replace other files in the EXFOR dir as the new ones are different.

3. Documentation has not yet been updated and is not provided. Use the one
   of empire-2.13 and the file Empire-Degas-Ecis.txt. The latter one
   together with the on-line help (EMPIRE input) contain enough details for
   using new features of the code.

3. List of new features and bug fixes is contained in the WHATSNEW file.
