Compilation:

On UNIX systems just run 'Compile' script inside the main empire 
directory. This will compile all components of the package including
utility codes. If you have used 'setup-emp' script to install 
EMPIRE-II this step is not needed as the whole package should 
already be compiled.

Running:

Use lrun.tcl script in the empire/work directory. This needs Tcl/Tk
and bash shell installed. 

Try also beta version of the new GUI (Xrun.tcl in the work directory).
Although not fully completed, this interface provides all functionalities
of the previous 'lrun.tcl' and much more (e.g., ZVV plotting of double
differential and single spectra, file managment features, and multiple
runs). Xrun.tcl needs Tcl/Tk, incr Widgets, and bash shell. The 
former three are included in most Linux distributions (e.g., RedHat) 
but might not be installed by default. They can also be downloaded free 
of charge from many web sites, e.g.: 

http://tcl.sourceforge.net/ (Tcl/Tk),
http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/iwidgets/index.html (incr Widgets). 

Otherwise one can use scripts provided in the empire/work directory. 
Please refer to EMPIRE-2.18 write-up in the empire/doc directory for 
more details.
