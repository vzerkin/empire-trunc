Compilation:

On UNIX systems just run 'Compile' script inside the main empire 
directory. This will compile all components of the package including
utility codes. If you have used 'setup-emp' script to install 
EMPIRE-II this step is not needed as the whole package should 
already be compiled.

Running:

Use lrun.tcl script in the empire/work directory. This needs Tcl/Tk
and bash shell installed. Otherwise one can use scripts also provided in the
empire/work directory. Please refer to EMPIRE-2.17 write-up in the
empire/doc directory for more details.
