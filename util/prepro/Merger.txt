      THIS PROGRAM ONLY USES THE ENDF/B BCD OR CARD IMAGE FORMAT (AS     Merger  
      OPPOSED TO THE BINARY FORMAT) AND CAN HANDLE DATA IN ANY VERSION   Merger  
      OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT (I.E., ENDF/B-I, II,III, IV OR V FORMAT).     Merger

      THE ONLY NUMERICAL DATA THAT THIS PROGRAM READS IS THE ZA FROM THE Merger  
      FIRST CARD OF EACH SECTION AND THE MAT/MF/MT FROM EACH CARD.       Merger  
      SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE IGNORED ON INPUT AND ALL OTHER FIELDS ARE     Merger  
      READ AS HOLLERITH. AS SUCH THIS PROGRAM NEED NOT DISTINGUISH       Merger  
      BETWEEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT.                   Merger

      IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DATA IS CORRECTLY CODED IN THE ENDF/B       Merger  
      FORMAT AND NO ERROR CHECKING IS PERFORMED. IN PARTICULAR IT IS     Merger  
      ASSUMED THAT THE MAT, MF AND MT ON EACH CARD IS CORRECT. SEQUENCE  Merger  
      NUMBERS (COLUMNS 76-80) ARE IGNORED ON INPUT, BUT WILL BE          Merger  
      CORRECTLY OUTPUT ON ALL CARDS.                                     Merger

      IS NO LIMIT TO THE SIZE OF ANY GIVEN SECTION, E.G. THE TOTAL       Merger

      THAT ONLY CERTAIN DATA SHOULD BE SELECTED. THE DATA TO BE          Merger  
      SELECTED IS DEFINED BY SPECIFYING UP TO 100 MAT/MF/MT OR           Merger

      MERELY SPECIFYING THE LOWER LIMIT OF MAT OR ZA. THE UPPER MAT OR   Merger  
      ZA LIMIT WILL BE SET EQUAL TO THE LOWER LIMIT, THE LOWER LIMITS OF Merger  
      MF/MT WILL BE 0/0 AND THE UPPER LIMITS OF MF/MT WILL BE SET TO     Merger

      IN ORDER FOR A SECTION TO MEET THE SELECTION CRITERIA SPECIFIED    Merger  
      BY ONE OF THE RETRIEVAL REQUESTS, EACH OF THE THREE FIELDS (       Merger  
      MAT/MF/MT OR ZA/MF/MT) MUST INDIVIDUALLY SATISFY THE CORRESPONDING Merger  
      LIMITS OF THE REQUEST. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT THE MAT OF A      Merger  
      SECTION LIE BETWEEN THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MATS OF A REQUEST. THE Merger  
      MF AND MT WILL ALSO BE INDIVIDUALLY COMPARED TO THE MF AND MT      Merger  
      LIMITS OF THE REQUEST. FOR EXAMPLE, A SECTION WITH MAT/MF/MT=      Merger  
      2500/3/2 DOES NOT SATISFY A REQUEST THAT SPECIFIES A REQUEST USING Merger  
      THE RANGE 2000/3/1 THROUGH 3000/3/1. THIS REQUEST SPECIFIES ALL    Merger  
      MATERIALS WITH MAT BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000, BUT ONLY THOSE SECTIONS  Merger  
      WITH MF/MT=3/1. SIMILARLY A REQUEST FOR 2000/3/1 THROUGH 3000/99/  Merger  
      999 WILL NOT SELECT ANY SECTIONS WITH MF=1 OR 2, SINCE THE         Merger  
      REQUEST SPECIFIES ALL MATERIALS WITH MAT BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000,    Merger  
      BUT ONLY THOSE SECTIONS WITH MF= 3, OR MORE.                       Merger  
                                                                         Merger

      ------------------                                                 Merger  
      IF TWO OR MORE SECTIONS WITH THE SAME MAT/MF/MT ARE FOUND EITHER   Merger  
      ON THE SAME OR DIFFERENT TAPES, THE SECTION FROM THE TAPE DEFINED  Merger  
      EARLIEST IN THE INPUT CARDS WILL BE COPIED TO THE FINAL TAPE AND   Merger  
      ALL OTHER SECTIONS WITH THE SAME MAT/MF/MT WILL BE SKIPPED. THE    Merger  
      OUTPUT REPORT WILL INDICATE WHICH SECTIONS WERE COPIED FROM WHICH  Merger  
      TAPES, AS WELL AS WHICH SECTIONS ARE DUPLICATE AND WERE SKIPPED.   Merger

      DEFINED ABOVE AND ONLY COPY ONE SECTION MF=1, MT=451 AND SKIP      Merger
