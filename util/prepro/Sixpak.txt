      ALL INTEGRATIONS ARE PERFORMED USING THE INTERPOLATION LAW GIVEN   Sixpak  
      FOR SECONDARY ENERGY AND/OR COSINE. INTEGRATIONS ARE NOT           Sixpak  
      PERFORMED OVER INCIDENT - ONLY INTEGRATION OVER SECONDARY ENERGY   Sixpak  
      AND/OR COSINE ARE PERFORMED AT EACH INCIDENT ENERGY. THEREFORE     Sixpak  
      THE INTERPOLATION LAW FOR INCIDENT ENERGY IS NOT USED BY THIS      Sixpak  
      CODE.                                                              Sixpak

      ALL INTERPOLATION LAWS ARE CHECKED. ALL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH       Sixpak  
      INTERPOLATION LAWS ARE CHECKED, E.G., NO NON-NEGATIVE VALUES       Sixpak  
      REQUIRING LOG INTERPOLATION. IN ORDER TO PERFORM REQUIRED          Sixpak  
      INTEGRALS OVER COS AND EP IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE INTERPOLATION  Sixpak  
      LAWS BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE DATA.                                  Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      ENDF/B-VI ALLOWS NEW INTERPOLATION LAWS FOR CORRESPONDING POINT    Sixpak  
      AND UNIT BASE TRANSFORMATION INTERPOLATION. NONE OF THESE NEW      Sixpak  
      INTERPOLATION LAWS ARE USED IN THE ENDF/B-VI LIBRARY AS OF         Sixpak  
      JANUARY 1992 TO INTERPOLATE IN SECONDARY ENERGY OR COSINE.         Sixpak  
      THEREFORE THIS PROGRAM CAN PERFORM ALL OF THE REQUIRED INTEGRALS   Sixpak  
      OVER SECONDARY ENERGY AND/OR COSINE USING ONLY THE OLDER           Sixpak  
      INTERPOLATION CODES. THIS PROGRAM ONLY PERFORMS INTEGRALS FOR      Sixpak  
      EACH INCIDENT ENERGY, SO THAT INTERPOLATION IN INCIDENT ENERGY     Sixpak  
      IS NOT PERFORMED BY THIS PROGRAM.                                  Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      NEW INTERPOLATION SCHEMES ARE USED FOR INCIDENT ENERGY - FOR       Sixpak  
      EXAMPLE, CORRESPONDING POINT INTERPOLATION IS SPECIFIED TO ALLOW   Sixpak  
      INTERPOLATION IN G0(E,EP) TO SIMULATE CASES WHERE THE INPUT ENERGY Sixpak  
      LIMIT IS DEFINED BY E-EP = A DIAGONAL CURVE ACROSS (E,EP) SPACE.   Sixpak  
      THIS INTERPOLATION CODE CANNOT BE SPECIFIED IN THE MF=5 OUTPUT     Sixpak  
      OF THIS CODE - MF=5 ONLY ALLOWS THE OLDER INTERPOLATION LAWS       Sixpak  
      INT=1 THROUGH 5. THEREFORE THIS PROGRAM WILL USE THE CLOSEST       Sixpak  
      CORRESPONDING INTERPOLATION CODE FOR OUTPUT TO MF=5. FOR USE       Sixpak  
      WHERE THE OUTPUT OF THIS CODE = LOW ENERGY APPLICATIONS - THIS     Sixpak  
      SHOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON RESULTS.                              Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      FOR CONSISTENCY WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF ENDF/B IN CREATING THE    Sixpak  
      ENDF/B OUTPUT, IF ANY INPUT INTERPOLATION LAW IS NOT IN THE        Sixpak  
      RANGE 1-5, IT WILL FIRST BE TESTED TO SEE IF MOD(10) IT IS         Sixpak  
      IN THIS RANGE, FINALLY IF EVEN THIS DOESN'T WORK IT IS SET         Sixpak  
      EQUAL TO 2 (LINEARLY INTERPOLATION). THIS METHOD WILL EFFECTIVELY  Sixpak  
      REPLACE CORRESPONDING POINT AND UNIT BASE TRANSFORMATION BY THE    Sixpak  
      CLOSEST RELATED INTERPOLATION LAW 1 THROUGH 5 - AGAIN NOTE, AS     Sixpak  
      OF JANUARY 1992 NONE OF THESE NEW LAWS ARE USED IN ENDF/B-VI. IF   Sixpak  
      THIS MUST BE DONE FOR INTERPOLATION IN SECONDARY ENERGY OR COSINE  Sixpak  
      AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED - SINCE THIS WOULD EFFECT THE     Sixpak  
      ACCURACY OF THE INTEGRALS PERFORMED BY THIS PROGRAM. IF THIS MUST  Sixpak  
      BE DONE FOR INCIDENT ENERGY NO MESSAGE IS PRINTED - SINCE THIS     Sixpak  
      WILL NOT EFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE INTEGRALS PERFORMED BY THIS    Sixpak  
      PROGRAM.                                                           Sixpak

      ================================================================== Sixpak  
      IN MANY CASES PEOPLE ASSUME THAT FOR HEAVY (HIGH ATOMIC WEIGHT)    Sixpak  
      MATERIALS THE CENTER-OF-MASS AND LAB SYSTEMS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL, Sixpak  
      SINCE IN THIS CASE THE CENTER-OF-MASS ENERGY WILL BE MUCH SMALLER  Sixpak  
      THAN THE INCIDENT ENERGY. FOR A PROCESS SUCH AS ELASTIC SCATTERING Sixpak  
      WHERE FOR HEAVY MATERIALS THE SECONDARY ENERGY, EP, WILL ALWAYS    Sixpak  
      BE A LARGE FRACTION OF THE INCIDENT ENERGY, THIS ASSUMPTION IS     Sixpak  
      VALID. HOWEVER, FOR THE TYPICAL REACTIONS INCLUDED IN MF=6 THIS    Sixpak  
      IS NOT ALWAYS TRUE - IN MANY OF THESE CASES THE SECONDARY ENERGY   Sixpak  
      CAN EXTEND ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO, AND IN PARTICULAR IT CAN      Sixpak  
      BE SMALL COMPARED TO THE CENTER-OF-MASS ENERGY - WHICH MAKES THE   Sixpak  
      TRANSFORMATION FROM CENTER-OF-MASS TO LAB IMPORTANT. THEREFORE     Sixpak  
      GENERALLY TO TREAT MF=6 DATA WE MUST CONSIDER THIS TRANSFORMATION. Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak

      THE ENERGY SPECTRA OUTPUT BY THIS CODE IN MF=5 MUST BE IN THE LAB  Sixpak

      THE JACOBIAN CAN BE DEFINED FROM,                                  Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak

      WITH THESE DEFINITIONS OF EP(LAB) AND COS(LAB) IN TERMS OF E(MM),  Sixpak  
      EP(CM) AND COS(CM) IT IS POSSIBLE TO PERFORM A POINT-BY-POINT      Sixpak  
      TRANSFORMATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CM TO LAB SYSTEM USING    Sixpak  
      THESE DEFINITIONS - OR IF WE WISHED WE COULD PERFORM THE REVERSE   Sixpak  
      TRANSFORMATION USING THE ABOVE RELATIONSHIPS AND THE IDENTITY,     Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak

      THIS IS NOT WHAT WILL BE DONE HERE, SINCE WE WILL ONLY BE          Sixpak  
      INTERESTED IN THE ZEROTH ORDER MOMENTS OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS,     Sixpak  
      BUT WE WILL BE INTERESTED IN DEFINING THOSE MOMENTS IN THE         Sixpak  
      LAB SYSTEM IN TERMS OF MF=6 SPECTRA GIVEN IN THE CM SYSTEM USING,  Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      F(E,EP(LAB),COS(LAB)) = F(E,EP(CM),COS(CM))*J                      Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      THE LIMITS OF EP(LAB) ARE DEFINED BY SETTING COS(CM) = +1 OR -1,   Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      EP(LAB)   = (SQRT(EP(CM)) + SQRT(E(MM)))**2  FOR COS(CM) = +1      Sixpak  
                = (SQRT(EP(CM)) - SQRT(E(MM)))**2  FOR COS(CM) = -1      Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      IN THIS FORM WE CAN SEE THAT AS LONG AS THE SECONDARY ENERGY IN    Sixpak  
      THE CENTER-OF-MASS SYSTEM, EP(CM), IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE         Sixpak  
      ENERGY OF THE CENTER-OF-MASS, E(MM), THE CENTER-OF-MASS AND LAB    Sixpak  
      ENERGIES WILL BE ALMOST EQUAL - SIMILARLY FOR THE COSINE, IN       Sixpak  
      THIS CASE COS(LAB) AND COS(CM) WILL BE ALMOST EQUAL - HOWEVER,     Sixpak  
      FOR THE MF=6 DATA WE CANNOT ASSUME THAT THIS IS TRUE.              Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      TO FIRST ORDER THE ANGULAR DEPENDENCE CAN BE IGNORED,              Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      EP(LAB)   = E(MM) + EP(CM)                                         Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT TO FIRST ORDER THE EFFECT OF TRANSFORMING    Sixpak  
      FROM THE CM TO LAB SYSTEM IS TO INCREASE THE ENERGY OF THE         Sixpak  
      EMITTED PARTICLE IN THE CENTER-OF-MASS SYSTEM BY THE ENERGY OF     Sixpak  
      THE CENTER-OF-MASS TO DEFINE THE LAB ENERGY.                       Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      NOT ONLY THE ENERGY, BUT ALSO THE SPECTRA MUST BE TRANSFORMED.     Sixpak  
      STARTING FROM THE DOUBLE DIFFERENTIAL DATA IN THE LAB SYSTEM,      Sixpak  
      F(E,EP,COS(LAB)), WE CAN DEFINE THE LAB SCALAR SPECTRUM AS,        Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      G0(E,EP) = INTEGRAL F(E,EP,COS(LAB))*D(COS(LAB))                   Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      THIS IS THE NORMAL CALCULATION DEFINED ABOVE AND USED FOR DATA     Sixpak  
      GIVEN IN THE LAB SYSTEM.                                           Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      STARTING FROM DATA IN THE CENTER OF MASS SYSTEM F(E,EP,COS(CM)),   Sixpak  
      WE CAN USE THE RELATIONSHIP,                                       Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      F(E,EP,COS(LAB))*D(COS(LAB)) = F(E,EP,COS(CM))*J*D(COS(LAB))       Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      J         = SQRT(EP(LAB)/EP(CM)) - THE JACOBIAN                    Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
                = E(MM)/EP(CM) + 1 + 2*COS(CM)*SQRT(E(MM)/EP(CM))        Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      AS IN THE CASE OF THE ENERGY, IN THIS FORM WE CAN SEE THAT AS      Sixpak  
      LONG AS THE SECONDARY ENERGY IN THE CENTER-OF-MASS SYSTEM,         Sixpak  
      EP(CM), IS LARGE COMPARED TO THE CENTER-OF-MASS ENERGY, E(MM),     Sixpak  
      THE JACOBIAN IS ESSENTIALLY UNITY AND THE CENTER-OF-MASS AND LAB   Sixpak  
      SPECTRA WILL BE VERY SIMILAR - AGAIN, GENERALLY WE CANNOT          Sixpak  
      ASSUME THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR THE MF=6 SPECTRA.                     Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      THEREFORE WE CAN ALSO DEFINE THE LAB SCALAR SPECTRUM IN TERMS OF   Sixpak  
      THE CM SPECTRUM IN THE FORM,                                       Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      G0(E,EP) = INTEGRAL F(E,EP,COS(CM))*J*D(COS(LAB))                  Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      CONSISTENT WITH THE ABOVE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ANGULAR DEPENDENCE   Sixpak  
      OF EP(LAB) CAN BE IGNORED THE JACOBIAN WILL NOT BE USED IN         Sixpak  
      PERFORMING THESE INTEGRALS - IN WHICH CASE THE INTEGRAL REDUCES    Sixpak  
      TO EXACTLY THE SAME FORM AS IF THE DATA WERE IN THE LAB SYSTEM.    Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT SINCE IN THIS CASE THE MF=4 ANGULAR        Sixpak  
      DISTRIBUTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE CM SYSTEM AND WHEN USED IN ANY      Sixpak  
      APPLICATION THEY WILL BE TRANSFORMED TO THE LAB SYSTEM - WHEN      Sixpak  
      THIS IS DONE THE JACOBIAN WILL BE APPLIED.                         Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      IN THIS CODE WHERE WE ARE MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH CONSERVING THE     Sixpak  
      NUMBER OF EMITTED PARTICLES AND AVERAGE ENERGIES THE NEUTRON       Sixpak  
      SPECTRA OUTPUT IN MF=5 WILL NOT BE COMPLETELY CONVERTED TO THE     Sixpak  
      LAB SYSTEM - ONLY FIRST ORDER CORRECTIONS WILL BE INCLUDED BY      Sixpak  
      INCREASING THE EMITTED PARTICLE ENERGY BY THE CENTER OF MASS       Sixpak  
      ENERGY, I.E., FOR A CENTER OF MASS SPECTRUM TABULATED AT CENTER    Sixpak  
      OF MASS ENERGIES EP(CM) THESE WILL ALL BE UNIFORMLY INCREASED      Sixpak  
      BY E(MM) TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CENTER OF MASS MOTION - THE SPECTRA    Sixpak  
      WILL NOT BE MODIFIED BY THE JACOBIAN FACTOR SQRT(EP(LAB)/EP(CM))   Sixpak  
      SINCE THIS WOULD REQUIRE A DETAILED TRANSFORMATION IN ENERGY AND   Sixpak  
      COS(THETA) SPACE - WHICH IS JUDGED NOT TO BE WORTH PERFORMING      Sixpak  
      WITHIN THE LIMITS OF WHERE THE OUTPUT FROM THIS CODE IS INTENDED   Sixpak  
      TO BE USED.                                                        Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      SINCE THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION IS ALWAYS OUTPUT IN THE SAME        Sixpak  
      SYSTEM AS WHICH IT IS GIVEN IN MF=6, NO TRANSFORMATION IS          Sixpak  
      REQUIRED FOR THE MF=4 OUTPUT.                                      Sixpak  
                                                                         Sixpak  
      WHEN USED IN LOW ENERGY APPLICATIONS (E.G., FISSION REACTORS) THE  Sixpak  
      HIGH ENERGY SPECTRA PRESENTED IN MF=6 WILL BE MOSTLY IMPORTANT     Sixpak  
      SIMPLY IN CONSERVING PARTICLES, (E.G., AS IN (N,2N)) AND ENERGY    Sixpak  
      AND THE DETAILS OF THE CORRELATION AND GROSS ENERGY SPECTRA WILL   Sixpak  
      NOTE PLAY THAT IMPORTANT A ROLE. IN THIS CASE THE SPECTRA OUTPUT   Sixpak  
      BY THIS PROGRAM IN MF=5 SHOULD BE ADEQUATE.                        Sixpak
