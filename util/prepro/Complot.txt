      THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON A VARIETY OF COMPUTERS FROM    Complot

      THE PROGRAM USES A SIMPLE CALCOMP LIKE GRAPHICS INTERFACE          Complot 
      (DESCRIBED BELOW) AND ALLOWS THE USER SPECIFY THE PHYSICAL SIZE    Complot

      CONVENTIONS THIS PROGRAM CAN BE EASILY INTERFACED TO VIRTUALLY     Complot

      PLOTTER DIMENSIONS ARE IN INCHES - NOT CM, MM, OR CUBITS.          Complot 
      THIS IS DONE FOR HISTORICAL REASONS AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL        Complot 
      NOT INCONVENIENCE ANYONE - IN PRACTICE I HAVE USED EXACTLY THE     Complot 
      SAME DIMENSION = X = 0 to 12.5 and Y = 0 to 10 FOR DECADES         Complot

      SECTIONS OF FILE 2 (RESONANCE PARAMETERS) AND FILES 3, 23 AND 27   Complot 
      (TABULATED DATA) WILL BE READ AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS WILL BE       Complot

      LIMITS OF THE RESOLVED AND UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION WHICH IS    Complot 
      LOCATED IN THE SAME FIELDS IN ALL VERSIONS OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT.   Complot 
      SIMILARLY THE FORMAT OF FILES 3, 23 AND 27 IS THE SAME IN ALL      Complot 
      VERSIONS OF ENDF/B. THEREFORE THIS PROGRAM CAN BE USED WITH DATA   Complot

      IN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT DIFFERENT MT NUMBERS    Complot 
      ARE ASSIGNED TO THE SAME REACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN ENDF/B-V AND    Complot 
      EARLIER VERSIONS OF ENDF/B THE PHOTOELECTRIC CROSS SECTION IS      Complot 
      MT=602, WHILE IN ENDF/B-VI IT IS MT=522. IN ORDER TO COMPARE       Complot 
      ASSUMING THAT THE MASTER IS ENDF/B-VI AND THE OTHER ENDF/B FILE    Complot 
      IS ENDF/B-V (OR EARLIER) YOU MAY EQUATE MT=522 TO 602.             Complot

      WHEN COMPARING PHOTOELECTRIC CROSS SECTIONS WE EXPECT THERE TO BE  Complot 
      LARGE DIFFERENCES NEAR EDGES, SINCE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT TWO        Complot 
      INDEPENDENT EVALUATIONS USE EXACTLY THE SAME EDGE ENERGIES. FROM   Complot 
      A PRACTICAL VIEWPOINT THESE DIFFERENCES ARE NOT IMPORTANT IF THEY  Complot 
      ONLY OCCUR OVER NARROW ENERGY RANGES NEAR ENERGIES. HOWEVER THESE  Complot 
      LARGE DIFFERENCES MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE DIFFERENCES OVER    Complot 
      OTHER ENERGY RANGES, WHICH MAY BE IMPORTANT. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE   Complot 
      TO SEE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE FOLLOWING COMPARISON WE WILL   Complot 
      CONSTRAIN THE PLOTTED RATIO TO THE RANGE ABOUT 0.9 TO 1.1 IN       Complot 
      ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE DIFFERENCES OF UP TO 10 PER-CENT. WE WILL  Complot 
      DO THIS BY SPECIFYING A MAXIMUM RATIO OF 1.1, WHICH WILL IN TURN   Complot
