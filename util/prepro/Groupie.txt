      IN THIS CASE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THE UNSHIELDED Groupie

      FOR 2 OR FEWER BANDS THE PROGRAM USES AN ANALYTIC EXPRESSION       Groupie 
      TO DEFINE ALL MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS. FOR MORE THAN 2 BANDS THE     Groupie 
      PROGRAM PERFORMS A NON-LINEAR FIT TO SELECT THE MULTI-BAND         Groupie 
      PARAMETERS THAT MINIMIZE THE MAXIMUM FRACTIONAL ERROR AT ANY       Groupie 
      POINT ALONG THE ENTIRE SELF-SHIELDING CURVE. THE NUMBER OF BANDS   Groupie 
      REQUIRED WITHIN ANY GIVEN GROUP IS DEFINED BY INSURING THAT THE    Groupie 
      MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS CAN BE USED TO ACCURATELY DEFINE SELF-       Groupie 
      SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS ALONG THE ENTIRE SELF-SHIELDING CURVE      Groupie 
      FROM SIGMA0 = 0 TO INFINITY. THE USER MAY DEFINE THE ACCURACY      Groupie 
      REQUIRED.                                                          Groupie

      THE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS   Groupie 
      OF ANY MIXTURE CAN BE CALCULATED BY THIS PROGRAM BY REALIZING THAT Groupie 
      THIS PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY ONLY USES THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION AS A    Groupie 
      WEIGHTING FUNCTION TO ACCOUNT FOR SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS. FOR A    Groupie 
      MIXTURE IT IS THEREFORE ONLY NECESSARY TO USE THE TOTAL CROSS      Groupie 
      SECTION FOR THE MIXTURE IN PLACE OF THE ACTUAL TOTAL CROSS SECTION Groupie 
      FOR EACH CONSTITUENT AND TO RUN THIS PROGRAM. THIS CAN BE DONE BY  Groupie 
      FIRST RUNNING PROGRAM MIXER TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY DEPENDENT      Groupie 
      TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR ANY COMPOSITE MIXTURE. NEXT, SUBSTITUTE    Groupie 
      THIS COMPOSITE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE ACTUAL TOTAL CROSS      Groupie 
      SECTION OF EACH CONSTITUENT (IN EACH ENDF/B FORMATTED EVALUATION). Groupie 
      FINALLY, RUN THIS PROGRAM TO CALCULATE THE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS     Groupie 
      SECTION FOR EACH CONSTITUENT, PROPERLY ACCOUNTING FOR RESONANCE    Groupie 
      OVERLAP BETWEEN THE RESONANCES OF ALL OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE   Groupie 
      MIXTURE. DURING THE SAME RUN THESE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS    Groupie 
      CAN IN TURN BE USED TO CALCULATE FULLY CORRELATED MULT-BAND        Groupie 
                                                                         Groupie
