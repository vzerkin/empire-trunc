      THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY DEPENDENT CROSS   Mixer   
      SECTION FOR A COMPOSITE MIXTURE OF UP TO 10 DIFFERENT MATERIALS.   Mixer   
                                                                         Mixer   
      THE PRESENT VERSION WILL ONLY CALCULATE THE CROSS SECTION FOR ONE  Mixer   
      FINAL REACTION (ENDF/B SECTION), E.G. TOTAL CROSS SECTION, BUT NOT Mixer

      NOTE, THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT COMBINE ALL REACTIONS FOR A MIXTURE    Mixer

      THE CROSS SECTIONS ARE READ FROM THE ENDF/B FORMAT AND THE         Mixer   
      COMPOSITE CROSS SECTION IS CONVERTED TO AN EQUIVALENT BARNS/ATOM   Mixer   
      FORM AND OUTPUT IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT WITH AN EQUIVALENT ATOMIC     Mixer   
      WEIGHT. THE USER MUST SPECIFY THE COMPOSITION BY GIVING THE ZA,    Mixer   
      MT AND GRAMS OR ATOMS OF EACH CONSTITUENT. IN ADDITION THE USER    Mixer   
      IDENTIFY THE COMPOSITE CROSS SECTION BY SPECIFYING THE ZA, MAT     Mixer   
      AND MT TO BE USED IN THE ENDF/B FORMATTED OUTPUT.                  Mixer

      SINCE ONLY THE CROSS SECTIONS IN FILE 3 AND 23 ARE USED, AND THE   Mixer   
      FORMAT FOR FILE 3/23 IS THE SAME IN ALL VERSIONS ON ENDF/B, THIS   Mixer   
      PROGRAM MAY BE USED WITH ANY VERSION OF ENDF/B DATA (I.E.,         Mixer   
      ENDF/B-I, II, III, IV, V OR VI). DURING A SINGLE RUN IT MAY EVEN   Mixer   
      BE USED TO READ AND COMBINE EVALUATIONS WHICH ARE IN DIFFERENT     Mixer

      ENDF/B FORMATTED OUTPUT WILL BE IN THE ENDF/B-VI FORMAT REGARDLESS Mixer   
      OF THE FORMAT OF THE INPUT ENDF/B DATA. THIS WILL ONLY EFFECT THE  Mixer   
      HOLLERITH SECTION (MF=1, MT=451). THE FORMAT OF CROSS SECTIONS     Mixer
