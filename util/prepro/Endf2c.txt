      ----------------                                                   Endf2c  
      I consider insuring that ENDF data is in a standard, officially    Endf2c  
      approved format for FORTRAN, C and C++ is SO IMPORTANT this code   Endf2c  
      does only one thing - and only one thing - and it does it in the   Endf2c  
      simplest possible manner - efficiency is NOT a consideration -     Endf2c  
      ONLY accuracy and general utility of the ENDF data is considered.  Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      Method                                                             Endf2c  
      ------                                                             Endf2c  
      Other codes that attempt to do the same thing - including codes    Endf2c  
      written be me decades ago - are very complicated, and therefore    Endf2c  
      ERROR PRONE because they try to deal with each and every variant   Endf2c  
      in which data can be coded in the ENDF format. Needless to say     Endf2c  
      this means that every time the ENDF formats and procedures change  Endf2c  
      these codes MUSE also be changed.                                  Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      In contrast, ENDF2C uses my almost 50 years of experience dealing  Endf2c  
      with the ENDF format to realize that except for the comments at    Endf2c  
      the beginning for each evaluation (MF/MT=1/451), every line of     Endf2c  
      ENDF data is IDENTICAL - in every version of the ENDF format, from Endf2c  
      the original ENDF to today's ENDF-6. So to translate ENDF data     Endf2c  
      into an official format I do not have to consider differences in   Endf2c  
      each section (MF/MT) of data.                                      Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      Every line of ENDF is divided into 6 fields, each 11 columns wide. Endf2c  
      Each of the 6 fields is either, blank, integer or floating point.  Endf2c  
      Floating point fields ALL include a decimal point (.). So that ALL Endf2c  
      this code does is convert every floating point field to standard   Endf2c  
      format.                                                            Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      In order to insure that this PRESERVES the accuracy of the data    Endf2c  
      this is done by reading and writing each ENDF line as characters.  Endf2c  
      Blank and integer fields are copied exactly as read. ALL floating  Endf2c  
      point number that are read are converted internally from character Endf2c  
      to floating point - they are then converted back into characters   Endf2c  
      in a standard, officially approved format, for output.             Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      As a last step to insure the accuracy of results the characters    Endf2c  
      to be output are again converted from characters to floating       Endf2c  
      point, and the numerical value that is output is compared to the   Endf2c  
      numerical value originally read, and if there is ANY DIFFERENCE    Endf2c  
      the characters strings read and written are listed in the output:  Endf2c  
      the characters strings read and written as well as the difference  Endf2c  
      is listed in the output report (ENDF2C.LST) and on the screen.     Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c  
      Running Time                                                       Endf2c  
      ------------                                                       Endf2c  
      It takes only seconds to translate an ENDF formatted evaluation,   Endf2c  
      so running time need not be a consideration. Concentrate on        Endf2c  
      keeping it simple and reliable - that should be your focus.        Endf2c  
                                                                         Endf2c

      allows data users to determine the pedigree of the data they are   Endf2c
