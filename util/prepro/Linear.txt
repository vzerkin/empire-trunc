      THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CONVERT ENDF/B FILE 3, 23 AND 27 DATA  Linear  
      TO LINEAR-LINEAR INTERPOLABLE FORM. ANY SECTION THAT IS ALREADY    Linear  
      LINEAR-LINEAR INTERPOLABLE WILL BE THINNED.                        Linear

      IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION FOR SIMPLICITY THE ENDF/B TERMINOLOGY  Linear  
      ---ENDF/B TAPE---WILL BE USED. IN FACT THE ACTUAL MEDIUM MAY BE    Linear

      THIS PROGRAM ONLY USES THE ENDF/B BCD OR CARD IMAGE FORMAT (AS     Linear  
      OPPOSED TO THE BINARY FORMAT) AND CAN HANDLE DATA IN ANY VERSION   Linear  
      OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT (I.E., ENDF/B-I, II,III, IV, V OR VI FORMAT). Linear

      IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DATA IS CORRECTLY CODED IN THE ENDF/B       Linear  
      FORMAT AND NO ERROR CHECKING IS PERFORMED. IN PARTICULAR IT IS     Linear  
      ASSUMED THAT THE MAT, MF AND MT ON EACH LINE IS CORRECT. SEQUENCE  Linear  
      NUMBERS (COLUMNS 76-80) ARE IGNORED ON INPUT, BUT WILL BE          Linear  
      CORRECTLY OUTPUT ON ALL LINES. THE FORMAT OF SECTION MF=1, MT=451  Linear  
      AND ALL SECTIONS OF MF=3 MUST BE CORRECT. THE PROGRAM COPIES ALL   Linear  
      OTHER SECTION OF DATA AS HOLLERITH AND AS SUCH IS INSENSITIVE TO   Linear  
      THE CORRECTNESS OR INCORRECTNESS OF ALL OTHER SECTIONS.            Linear

      IN THIS VERSION OF LINEAR ALL ENERGIES WILL BE OUTPUT IN           Linear  
      F (INSTEAD OF E) FORMAT IN ORDER TO ALLOW ENERGIES TO BE WRITTEN   Linear  
      WITH UP TO 9 DIGITS OF ACCURACY. IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS THIS WAS AN  Linear  
      OUTPUT OPTION. HOWEVER USE OF THIS OPTION TO COMPARE THE RESULTS   Linear  
      OF ENERGIES WRITTEN IN THE NORMAL ENDF/B CONVENTION OF 6 DIGITS    Linear  
      TO THE 9 DIGIT OUTPUT FROM THIS PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED THAT FAILURE  Linear  
      TO USE THE 9 DIGIT OUTPUT CAN LEAD TO LARGE ERRORS IN THE DATA     Linear  
      DUE TO TRUNCATION OF ENERGIES TO 6 DIGITS DURING OUTPUT.           Linear

      THESE COMMENT LINES ARE ONLY ADDED TO EXISTING HOLLERITH SECTIONS, Linear  
      I.E., THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT CREATE A HOLLERITH SECTION. THE FORMAT Linear  
      OF THE HOLLERITH SECTION IN ENDF/B-V DIFFERS FROM THE THAT OF      Linear  
      EARLIER VERSIONS OF ENDF/B. BY READING AN EXISTING MF=1, MT=451    Linear  
      IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF      Linear  
      THE ENDF/B FORMAT THE DATA IS IN. WITHOUT HAVING A SECTION OF      Linear  
      MF=1, MT=451 PRESENT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO          Linear  
      DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT THE DATA IS IN, AND   Linear  
      AS SUCH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHAT FORMAT  Linear  
      SHOULD BE USED TO CREATE A HOLLERITH SECTION.                      Linear

      THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT USE THE REACTION INDEX WHICH IS GIVEN IN     Linear  
      SECTION MF=1, MT=451 OF EACH EVALUATION.                           Linear

      THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT UPDATE THE REACTION INDEX IN MF=1, MT=451.   Linear  
      THIS CONVENTION HAS BEEN ADOPTED BECAUSE MOST USERS DO NOT         Linear  
      REQUIRE A CORRECT REACTION INDEX FOR THEIR APPLICATIONS AND IT WAS Linear  
      NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE TO INCLUDE THE OVERHEAD OF CONSTRUCTING  Linear  
      A CORRECT REACTION INDEX IN THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IF YOU REQUIRE  Linear  
      A REACTION INDEX FOR YOUR APPLICATIONS, AFTER RUNNING THIS PROGRAM Linear  
      YOU MAY USE PROGRAM DICTIN TO CREATE A CORRECT REACTION INDEX.     Linear  
                                                                         Linear

      SINCE THIS PROGRAM USES A LOGICAL PAGING SYSTEM THERE IS NO LIMIT  Linear  
      TO THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN ANY SECTION, E.G., THE TOTAL CROSS      Linear  
      SECTION MAY BE REPRESENTED BY 200,000 DATA POINTS.                 Linear  
                                                                         Linear  
      FOR ANY LINEARIZED SECTION THAT CONTAINS 60000 OR FEWER POINTS     Linear  
      THE ENTIRE OPERATION WILL BE PERFORMED IN CORE AND THE LINEARIZED  Linear  
      DATA WILL BE OUTPUT DIRECTLY TO THE ENDF/B FORMAT. FOR ANY SECTION Linear  
      THAT CONTAINS MORE POINTS THE DATA WILL BE LINEARIZED A PAGE AT A  Linear  
      TIME (1 PAGE = 60000 POINTS) AND OUTPUT TO SCRATCH. AFTER THE      Linear  
      ENTIRE SECTION HAS BEEN LINEARIZED THE DATA WILL BE READ BACK FROM Linear  
      SCRATCH AND OUTPUT TO THE ENDF/B FORMAT.                           Linear

      -----------------                                                  Linear  
      THE PROGRAM SELECTS DATA TO BE LINEARIZED BASED EITHER ON EITHER   Linear  
      MAT (ENDF/B MAT NO.) OR ZA AS WELL AS MF AND MT NUMBERS. THIS      Linear  
      PROGRAM ALLOWS UP TO 100 MAT/MF/MT OR ZA/MF/MT RANGES TO BE        Linear  
      SPECIFIED BY INPUT PARAMETERS. THE PROGRAM WILL ASSUME THAT THE    Linear  
      ENDF/B TAPE IS IN MAT ORDER, REGARDLESS OF THE CRITERIA USED       Linear  
      TO RETRIEVE MATERIALS. IF RETRIEVAL IS BY MAT RANGE THE PROGRAM    Linear  
      WILL TERMINATE WHEN A MAT IS FOUND THAT IS ABOVE ALL REQUESTED     Linear  
      MAT RANGES. IF RETRIEVAL IS BY ZA RANGE THE PROGRAM WILL SEARCH    Linear  
      THE ENTIRE ENDF/B TAPE.                                            Linear  
                                                                         Linear

      EACH SECTION OF DATA IS CONSIDERED SEPARATELY. EACH SECTION OF     Linear  
      ENDF/B DATA TO LINEARIZE IS REPRESENTED BY A TABLE OF ENERGY       Linear  
      VS. CROSS SECTION AND ANY ONE OF FIVE ALLOWABLE INTERPOLATION LAWS Linear  
      BETWEEN ANY TWO TABULATED POINTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL REPLACE EACH   Linear  
      SECTION OF DATA CROSS SECTIONS BY A NEW TABLE OF ENERGY VS.        Linear  
      CROSS SECTION IN WHICH THE INTERPOLATION LAW IS ALWAYS LINEAR IN   Linear  
      ENERGY AND CROSS SECTION BETWEEN ANY TWO TABULATED POINTS.         Linear  
                                                                         Linear  
      DATA IS READ AND LINEARIZED A PAGE AT A TIME (ONE PAGE CONTAINS    Linear  
      60000 DATA POINTS). IF THE FINAL LINEARIZED SECTION CONTAINS TWO   Linear  
      PAGES OR LESS, DATA POINTS IT WILL BE ENTIRELY CORE RESIDENT       Linear  
      AFTER IT HAS BEEN LINEARIZED AND WILL BE WRITTEN DIRECTLY FROM     Linear  
      CORE TO THE OUTPUT TAPE. IF THE LINEARIZED SECTION IS LARGER THAN  Linear  
      TWO PAGES, AFTER EACH PAGE IS LINEARIZED IT WILL BE WRITTEN TO     Linear  
      SCRATCH. AFTER THE ENTIRE SECTION HAS BEEN LINEARIZED IT WILL      Linear  
      BE READ BACK FROM SCRATCH, TWO PAGES AT A TIME, AND WRITTEN TO     Linear  
      THE OUTPUT TAPE.                                                   Linear  
                                                                         Linear

      --------------------------                                         Linear  
      SOMETIMES IT IS CONVENIENT TO KEEP ALL ENERGY POINTS WHICH WERE    Linear  
      PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION AND TO MERELY SUPPLEMENT THESE  Linear  
      POINTS WITH ADDITIONAL ENERGY POINTS IN ORDER TO LINEARIZE THE     Linear  
      CROSS SECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS OFTEN CONVENIENT TO KEEP THE    Linear  
      THERMAL VALUE (AT 0.0253 EV) OR THE VALUE AT 14.1 MEV.             Linear  
                                                                         Linear  
      THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW THE USER TO KEEP    Linear  
      ALL ORIGINAL EVALUATED DATA POINTS BY SPECIFYING 1 IN COLUMNS      Linear  
      34-44 OF THE FIRST INPUT LINE. THIS WILL TURN OFF THE BACKWARD     Linear  
      THINNING (SEE UCRL-50400, VOL. 17, PART A FOR EXPLANATION) AND     Linear  
      RESULT IN ALL ORIGINAL ENERGY POINTS BEING KEPT. CAUTION SHOULD    Linear  
      BE EXERCISED IN USING THIS OPTION SINCE IT CAN RESULT IN A         Linear  
      CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DATA POINTS OUTPUT BY       Linear  
      THIS CODE.                                                         Linear  
                                                                         Linear  
      FOR ALL USERS WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THIS OPTIONS NO CHANGES    Linear  
      ARE REQUIRED IN THE INPUT TO THIS PROGRAM, I. E. IF COLUMNS        Linear  
      34-44 ARE BLANK (AS FOR ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS CODE) THE    Linear  
      PROGRAM WILL OPERATE EXACTLY AS IT DID BEFORE.                     Linear  
                                                                         Linear

      ---------------                                                    Linear  
      ALLOWABLE ERROR MUST ALWAYS BE SPECIFIED IN THE INPUT TO THIS      Linear  
      PROGRAM AS A FRACTION, NOT A PER-CENT. FOR EXAMPLE, INPUT THE      Linear  
      ALLOWABLE FRACTIONAL ERROR 0.001 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN DATA THAT IS   Linear  
      ACCURATE TO WITHIN 0.1 PER-CENT.                                   Linear  
                                                                         Linear  
      THE CONVERSION OF THE DATA FROM THE GENERAL INTERPOLATION FORM TO  Linear  
      LINARLY INTERPOLABLE FORM CANNOT BE PERFORMED EXACTLY. HOWEVER, IT Linear  
      CAN BE PERFORMED TO VIRTUALLY ANY REQUIRED ACCURACY AND MOST       Linear  
      IMPORTANTLY CAN BE PERFORMED TO A TOLERANCE THAT IS SMALL COMPARED Linear  
      TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CROSS SECTIONS THEMSELVES. AS SUCH THE   Linear
