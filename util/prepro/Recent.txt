      THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RECONSTRUCT THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTION Recent  
      TO THE CROSS SECTION IN LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE FORM, ADD IN ANY     Recent  
      LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE BACKGROUND CROSS SECTION AND OUTPUT THE      Recent  
      RESULT IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT. THE CROSS SECTIONS OUTPUT BY THIS     Recent  
      PROGRAM WILL BE LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE OVER THE ENTIRE ENERGY RANGE Recent  
                                                                         Recent  
      THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTION IS CALCULATED FOR TOTAL (MT=1),         Recent  
      ELASTIC (MT=2), CAPTURE (MT=102) AND FISSION (MT=18), ADDED        Recent

      IS A FIRST CHANCE FISSION (MT=19) BACKGROUND PRESENT THE RESONANCE Recent  
      CONTRIBUTION OF FISSION WILL BE ADDED TO THE BACKGROUND AND        Recent  
      OUTPUT. IF THERE IS NO FIRST CHANCE FISSION (MT=19) BACKGROUND     Recent

      IT HAS NOW BEEN CONFIRMED (PRIVATE COMMUNICATION, CHARLES DUNFORD, Recent  
      APRIL, 1991) THAT THE PROPER PROCEDURE TO FOLLOW WHEN THERE ARE    Recent  
      MISSING OR DUPLICATE J VALUES IS TO IN ALL CASES ADD A SEQUENCE    Recent  
      WITH NO RESONANCES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE SEQUENCE Recent  
      TO THE POTENTIAL SCATTERING CROSS SECTION.                         Recent

      THIS PROGRAM ONLY USES THE ENDF/B BCD OR LINE IMAGE FORMAT (AS     Recent  
      OPPOSED TO THE BINARY FORMAT) AND CAN HANDLE DATA IN ANY VERSION   Recent  
      OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT (I.E., ENDF/B-I, II,III, IV, V OR VI FORMAT). Recent  
                                                                         Recent  
      IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DATA IS CORRECTLY CODED IN THE ENDF/B       Recent  
      FORMAT AND NO ERROR CHECKING IS PERFORMED. IN PARTICULAR IT IS     Recent  
      ASSUMED THAT THE MAT, MF AND MT ON EACH LINE IS CORRECT. SEQUENCE  Recent  
      NUMBERS (COLUMNS 76-80) ARE IGNORED ON INPUT, BUT WILL BE          Recent  
      CORRECTLY OUTPUT ON ALL CARDS. THE FORMAT OF SECTION MF=1, MT=451  Recent  
      AND ALL SECTIONS OF MF=2 AND 3 MUST BE CORRECT. THE PROGRAM COPIES Recent  
      ALL OTHER SECTION OF DATA AS HOLLERITH AND AS SUCH IS INSENSITIVE  Recent  
      TO THE CORRECTNESS OR INCORRECTNESS OF ALL OTHER SECTIONS.         Recent

      VARIES FROM ONE VERSION OF ENDF/B TO THE NEXT. HOWEVER, IF THE     Recent  
      HOLLERITH SECTION (MF=1, MT=451) IS PRESENT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR     Recent  
      THIS PROGRAM TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DATA IN THE ENDF/B-IV, V AND   Recent

      THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS -2*GJ*(X**2 + Y**2), SO THAT     Recent  
      REGARDLESS OF HOW WE DEFINE (X) AND (Y) THE INCLUSION OF THIS      Recent  
      TERM WILL ALWAYS DECREASE ABSORPTION. SINCE THE TOTAL CROSS        Recent  
      SECTION IS THE SAME IN BOTH CASE, THIS MEANS THAT THE ELASTIC      Recent  
      HAS BEEN INCREASED BY THIS AMOUNT.                                 Recent

      AGAIN, THESE RESULTS ARE BASED ON STARTING FROM EXACTLY THE SAME   Recent  
      PARAMETERS - IN ANY ACTUAL CASE THE PARAMETERS BASED ON A SINGLE   Recent  
      OR MULTI-LEVEL FIT WILL BE QUITE DIFFERENT - THE POINT THAT WE     Recent  
      WANT TO STRESS HERE IS THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER USE PARAMETERS        Recent  
      WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY A FIT USING ONE FORMALISM - IN THE      Recent  
      EQUATIONS FOR A DIFFERENT FORMALISM - AND ASSUME THAT THE RESULTS  Recent  
      WILL BE CONSISTENT - AND NEVER USE THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION TO      Recent  
      SEE WHETHER OR NOT A SET OF SINGLE LEVEL PARAMETERS CAN BE USED    Recent

      WHAT ARE THIS TERMS (X) AND (Y)                                    Recent  
      ===============================                                    Recent  
      (X) AND (Y) CAN BE EASILY IDENTIFIED BY CONSIDERING THE SINGLE     Recent

      FIND THAT,                                                         Recent

      IS NEGATIVE FOR E LESS THAN ER AND POSITIVE FOR E GREATER THAN     Recent  
      ER. I WILL MERELY MENTION THAT THE EQUATIONS FOR ALL FORMALISMS    Recent  
      IN ENDF-102 DO NOT CONSISTENTLY USE (E - ER) - IN SOME CASES       Recent  
      THIS IS WRITTEN AS (ER - E), WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN INCORRECT        Recent  
      SIGN IN THE DEFINITION OF THE (Y) THAT WE REQUIRE.                 Recent  
                                                                         Recent

      2) LEVEL-LEVEL INTERFERENCE = THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH LEVEL       Recent  
                                    INTERFERRRING WITH ALL OTHER LEVELS  Recent

      TO SEE THE EFFECT OF INCLUDING MULTI-LEVEL INTERFERENCE WE CAN     Recent  
      CONSIDER OUR GENERAL EXPRESSION FOR ABSORPTION,                    Recent  
                                                                         Recent

      AND NOTE THAT FOR BOTH SINGLE AND MULTI-LEVEL BREIT WIGNER THE     Recent  
      ENDF-102 SAYS TO TREAT ABSORPTION IN A SINGLE LEVEL APPROXIMATION  Recent  
      I.E., IGNORE LEVEL-LEVEL INTERFERENCE. IF ALL INTERFERENCE IS      Recent  
      IGNORED THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO COMPLETELY IGNORING X**2 + Y**2 AND  Recent  
      DEFINING,                                                          Recent

      WHICH IS INCORRECT - SINCE THIS SEEMS TO INDICATE EVERYTHING IS    Recent  
      ABSORBED. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE CORRECT EXPRESSION WE CANNOT      Recent  
      COMPLETELY IGNORE INTERFERENCE - WE CAN IGNORE LEVEL-LEVEL         Recent  
      INTERFERENCE, BUT WE MUST INCLUDE LEVEL-SELF INTERFERENCE,         Recent

      AN IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE IS THE DEFINITION OF (X) AND (Y)        Recent  
      WHICH IN ALL CASES WILL CORRESPOND TO THE SYMMETRIC AND            Recent  
      ANTI-SYMMETRIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE RESONANCES. IN PARTICULAR       Recent  
      DEFINING (U) IN TERMS OF (1-X) INSTEAD OF (X) IS EXTREMELY         Recent  
      IMPORTANT. NOTE, THAT THE DEFINITION OF THE ELASTIC AND            Recent  
      ABSORPTION ONLY INVOLVE (X), NOT (1-X). FAR FROM RESONANCES        Recent  
      (X) CAN BE EXTREMELY SMALL, THEREFORE (1-X) WILL BE VERY CLOSE     Recent  
      TO (1). IF THE CALCULATION PROCEEDS BY FIRST CALCULATING (1-X)     Recent  
      AND THEN DEFINING (X) BY SUBTRACTING (1), EXTREME ROUND-OFF        Recent  
      PROBLEMS CAN RESULT. THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE AVOIDED BY IN ALL       Recent  
      CASES DEFINING (X) DIRECTLY, WITHOUT ANY DIFFERENCES.              Recent

      IN EACH FORMALISM THE DEFINITION OF (X) AND (Y) MAY BE DIFFERENT   Recent

      (2) FOR A GIVEN TARGET SPIN AND L VALUE THERE MAY BE 2 POSSIBLE    Recent  
          MEANS OF OBTAINING THE SAME J VALUE. WHEN THIS OCCURS IN       Recent  
          ORDER TO CALCULATE THE CORRECT POTENTIAL SCATTERING CROSS      Recent  
          SECTION IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF BOTH          Recent  
          POSSIBLE J SEQUENCES, EVEN THOUGH FROM THE ENDF/B DATA IT IS   Recent  
          NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE 2 POSSIBLE SEQUENCES    Recent  
          ANY GIVEN RESONANCE BELONGS TO. IN THIS CASE THIS PROGRAM      Recent  
          TREAT ALL RESONANCES WITH THE SAME J VALUE AS BELONGING TO     Recent  
          THE SAME J SEQUENCE (TO ALLOW INTERFERENCE) AND WILL ADD AN    Recent  
          ADDITIONAL J SEQUENCE WITH NO RESONANCES IN ORDER TO ALLOW     Recent  
          THE POTENTIAL CROSS SECTION TO BE CALCULATED CORRECTLY. WHEN   Recent  
          THIS OCCURS A WARNING MESSAGE IS PRINTED, BUT BASED ON THE     Recent

          POSSIBLE J ARE 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 AND 1/2, 3/2. BY CHECKING THE     Recent  
          ENDF/B DATA IT IS POSSIBLE TO INSURE THAT THE 3 POSSIBLE       Recent  
          J VALUES (1/2, 3/2, 5/2) ARE PRESENT AND TO INCLUDE ALL 3      Recent  
          J SEQUENCES IN THE CALCULATIONS. HOWEVER, UNLESS ALL 5         Recent  
          POSSIBLE J SEQUENCES ARE INCLUDED THE STATISTICAL WEIGHTS      Recent  
          OF THE J SEQUENCES WILL NOT SUM UP TO 2*L+1 AND THE            Recent  
          POTENTIAL CROSS SECTION WILL BE UNDERESTIMATED. IN THIS        Recent  
          EXAMPLE THE SUM OF THE 3 J SEQUENCES 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 IS 2,       Recent  
          RATHER THAN 3 AS IT SHOULD BE FOR L=1, AND THE CONTRIBUTION    Recent  
          OF THE L=1 RESONANCES TO THE POTENTIAL SCATTERING CROSS        Recent  
          SECTION WILL ONLY BE 2/3 OF WHAT IT SHOULD BE, UNLESS THE      Recent  
          OTHER 2 J SEQUENCES (WITH DUPLICATE J VALUES) ARE INCLUDED     Recent

      (3) EACH RESONANCE MUST HAVE AN ASSIGNED, PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE      Recent  
          J VALUE. PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE OR AVERAGE J VALUES CANNOT BE   Recent  
          UNIQUELY INTERPRETED USING THE EQUATIONS IN ENDF-102 AND       Recent  
          THEIR USE WILL USUALLY RESULT IN PHYSICALLY UNRELIABLE CROSS   Recent  
          SECTIONS. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHECK ALL J VALUES AND IF ANY ARE  Recent  
          ARE FOUND TO BE PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE (BASED ON TARGET SPIN    Recent

          (A) IT CANNOT BE STRESSED ENOUGH THAT CROSS SECTIONS OBTAINED  Recent  
              USING PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE J VALUES FOR REICH-MOORE AND   Recent  
              MULTI-LEVEL BREIT-WIGNER RESONANCE PARAMETERS WILL RESULT  Recent  
              IN UNRELIABLE CROSS SECTIONS. THE DECISION TO HAVE THIS    Recent  
              PROGRAM CONTINUE TO PROCESS WHEN THIS CONDITION IS FOUND   Recent  
              IS BASED ON AN ATTEMPT TO ALLOW THE USER TO AT LEAST HAVE  Recent  
              SOME RESULTS (HOWEVER BAD THEY MAY BE) IF THERE IS NO      Recent  
              OTHER EVALUATED DATA AVAILABLE.                            Recent  
          (B) EVEN THOUGH THE REICH-MOORE AND MULTI-LEVEL EQUATIONS ARE  Recent  
              DEFINED AS ABSOLUTE OR SQUARED CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH MUST    Recent  
              ALL BE PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE, ATTEMPTING TO CORRECT THE      Recent  
              POTENTIAL CROSS SECTION (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE) CAN LEAD TO   Recent  
              NEGATIVE ELASTIC CROSS SECTIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE BASED ON  Recent  
              THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE EVALUATION IT IS NOT      Recent  
              NOT POSSIBLE TO CORRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE INTERFERENCE     Recent

      IN THE UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION THE UNRESOLVED PARAMETERS       Recent  
      ARE USED TO CALCULATE INFINITELY DILUTE AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS.    Recent  
      NOTE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE DEFINITION OF    Recent  
      THE UNRESOLVED PARAMETERS IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO UNIQUELY CALCULATE Recent  
      ENERGY DEPENDENT CROSS SECTIONS. ONLY AVERAGES OR DISTRIBUTIONS    Recent  
      MAY BE CALCULATED.                                                 Recent

      IN THE UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION CROSS SECTIONS AT EACH ENERGY   Recent  
      ARE CALCULATED BY INTERPOLATING PARAMETERS. THIS IS THE CONVENTION Recent  
      USED IN ENDF/B-IV AND EARLIER VERSIONS OF ENDF/B. THE ENDF/B-V     Recent  
      CONVENTION OF INTERPOLATING CROSS SECTIONS, NOT PARAMETERS, HAS    Recent  
      BEEN ABANDONED AS IMPRACTICAL SINCE IT CAN LEAD TO THE SITUATION   Recent  
      WHERE EXACTLY THE SAME PHYSICAL DATA CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT RESULTS Recent  
      DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THE THREE ENDF/B UNRESOLVED PARAMTER FORMATS Recent  
      IS USED. FOR EXAMPLE, GIVEN A SET OF ENERGY INDEPENDENT UNRESOLVED Recent  
      PARAMETERS IT IS POSSIBLE TO CODE THESE PARAMETERS IN EACH OF THE  Recent  
      THREE ENDF/B UNRESOLVED PARAMETER FORMATS. SINCE PHYSICALLY WE     Recent  
      ONLY HAVE ONE SET OF PARAMETERS WE WOULD EXPECT THE RESULTS TO BE  Recent  
      INDEPENDENT OF HOW THEY ARE REPRESENTED IN ENDF/B. UNFORTUNATELY   Recent  
      USING THE ENDF/B-V CONVENTION TO INTERPOLATE CROSS SECTIONS CAN    Recent  
      LEAD TO THREE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT RESULTS. IN CONTRAST USING THE  Recent  
      ENDF/B-IV AND EARLIER CONVENTION OF INTERPOLATING PARAMETERS LEADS Recent  
      TO COMPLETELY CONSISTENT RESULTS.                                  Recent
