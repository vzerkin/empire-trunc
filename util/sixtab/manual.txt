  Manual for Program SIXTAB
  =========================

  The SIXTAB program is an extension of the IAEA PrePro codes by
  D.E.Cullen [1], which are designed to perform various operations
  on the basic ENDF-formatted evaluated nuclear data files to
  simplify the interpretation of the results.

  The double differential data in an ENDF file MF 6 can be represented
  in various forms, including Legendre coefficients, Kalbach-Mann
  formalism, pointwise representation, CM or Lab frame of reference.
  This may make subsequent handling of the files rather difficult.
  The purpose of SIXTAB is to convert MF 6 data into pointwise
  representation in the Lab system (Law 7 ENDF format option).

  WARNINGS:
  1. The resulting file is generally not a substitute for the
     original file due to the assumed limitations built into
     the code. The number of angles in general may be insufficient
     to accurately represent the original data.
  2. The full complexity of the ENDF file MF 6  representation is
     not coded at present:
      - The data for the first particle only are processed at
        present.
      - Only Law 1 Legendre (LANG=1) or tabulated (LANG>10)
        representations are allowed.

  Instructions
  ------------
  Several forms of input are allowed:

   A.  If the file "SIXTAB.INP" exists, the file is scanned for
       input instructions. They may be given in the "old style"
       or in a more flexible keyword-oriented mode.

   A.  If the file "SIXTAB.INP" does not exist, and the first record
       on the default input does NOT begin with the string "$* ",
       the default input is the source ENDF file and the default
       output is the reformatted output ENDF file.

   B.  If the file "SIXTAB.INP" does not exist, and the first record
       on the default input begins with the string "$* ", the
       default input is read as a set of keyword-oriented input
       instructions.

  Old-style input instructions format:
  Two records are expected from input:
  - Name of the source ENDF file.
  - Name of the target ENDF file to be written.

  Keyword-oriented input instructions:
  The format follows a few simple rules, which are worth noting
  - Parameters are read in columns of 10. 
  - The first 10 columns are interpreted as the keyword.
  - Records with blanks in the first 10 columns are ignored, so
    comments may be entered freely in the input file, provided
    they appear on separate records and start after column 10.
  - Only keywords that are recognised by the program are processed.
  - The absence of a keyword for a particular parameter activates
    the default value of the parameter preset in the code.
  These rules allow the input instructions for several programs to
  appear on the same input file, provided all programs follow the
  above rules. This significantly reduces input file maintenance
  for more complicated sequences of code execution and possible
  archival of the input file for Quality Assurance purposes.

  Keyword
  '$* SIXTAB ' The main keyword of the SIXTAB program. All
               preceeding input is ignored.
  '   FLNINP ' Name of the source ENDF input file is given in
               columns 11-50.
  '   FLNOUT ' Name of the target ENDF output file is given in
               columns 11-50.
  '   NANGLES' Number of discrete angles for tabulation are defined
               columns 11-20.
  '   ENDSIX ' This keyword signals the end of SIXTAB input. All
               instructions that follow are ignored.

  File units:
   Name No. Description:
    LIN  1  Input instructions file, if not read from default input.
    LEN  2  Source ENDF input file, if not read from default input.
    LOU  3  Target ENDF output file, if not written to the default
            output.
    LKB  5  Default input.
    LTT  6  Default output.
