     THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO TRANSLATE EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM THE  
     EXFOR FORMAT TO A COMPUTATION FORMAT.                             
                                                                       
     WHAT COMPUTERS WILL THE PROGRAM RUN ON                            
     ======================================                            
     THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED ON AN IBM MAINFRAME AND AN IBM   
     PERSONAL COMPUTER. THE PROGRAM IS SMALL ENOUGH TO RUN ON VIRTUALLY
     ANY COMPUTER. FOR SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS SEE THE SECTION BELOW ON 
     COMPUTER DEPENDENT CODING.                                        
                                                                       
     EXFOR FORMAT                                                      
     ============                                                      
     THE EXFOR FORMAT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW EXPERIMENTALLY MEASURED DATA
     TO BE CODED IN A COMPUTER READABLE FORMAT IN A VERY FLEXIBLE FORM.
     IN PARTICULAR THE DATA CAN BE ENTERED IN ESSENTIALLY ANY SET OF   
     UNITS (E.G., EV VS. BARNS OR KEV VS. MILLI-BARNS) AND IN ANY TABLE
     FORMAT; ESSENTIALLY THE TABLE MAY BE ENTERED EXACTLY AS PUBLISHED 
     BY AN AUTHOR (E.G., ENERGY FOLLOWED BY COLUMNS OF CROSS SECTIONS  
     IN ANY ORDER).                                                    
                                                                       
     THE EXFOR FORMAT IS TABLE ORIENTED IN THE SENSE THAT DATA FROM A  
     GIVEN MEASUREMENT ARE COLLECTED TOGETHER AND CAN BE PRESENTED IN  
     A SINGLE, OR AS A SERIES OF TABLES.                               
                                                                       
     THE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXFOR FORMAT IS THAT SINCE DATA CAN BE CODED 
     ESSENTIALLY AS PUBLISHED BY AN AUTHOR PROBLEMS OF UNIT CONVERSION 
     AND RE-FORMATTING TABLES PRIOR TO CODING ARE AVOIDED AND THE      
     AUTHOR CAN EASILY CHECK THE CODED DATA. THE RESULT IS A GREATLY   
     IMPROVED RELIABILITY OF THE CODED DATA.                           
                                                                       
     THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE EXFOR FORMAT IS THAT SINCE PHYSICALLY     
     COMPARABLE DATA FROM DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS (E.G. FE-56 TOTAL     
     CROSS SECTIONS) MAY BE GIVEN IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT UNITS AND  
     FORMATS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IN APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION  
     THE TABLE ORIENTED EXFOR SYSTEM MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO COLLECT     
     TOGETHER PHYSICALLY COMPARABLE DATA FROM DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS.  
                                                                       
     COMPUTATION FORMAT                                                
     ==================                                                
     THE COMPUTATION FORMAT USED BY THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PRESENT
     EXPERIMENTAL DATA IN A FIXED SET OF UNITS AND COLUMN ORDER. BY    
     STARTING FROM DATA IN THE EXFOR FORMAT AND TRANSLATING DATA TO    
     THE COMPUTATION FORMAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES   
     OF THE IMPROVED RELIABILITY OF THE DATA CODED IN THE EXFOR FORMAT 
     WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF A FIXED UNIT AND COLUMN ORDER FORMAT FOR   
     USE IN SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS.                                   
                                                                       
     IN ADDITION THE COMPUTATION FORMAT IS POINT ORIENTED (AS OPPOSED  
     THE TABLE ORIENTED EXFOR FORMAT). EACH LINE OF THE COMPUTATION    
     FORMAT REPRESENTS A SINGLE DATA POINT. THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO  
     SORT DATA IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT INTO ANY DESIRED ORDER FOR USE
     IN APPLICATION, E.G., SORT 26-FE-26 (N,2N) DATA FROM A NUMBER OF  
     MEASUREMENTS TOGETHER INTO ENERGY ORDER TO SIMPLIFY COMPARISONS.  
                                                                       
     EXFOR VS. COMPUTATION FORMAT                                      
     ============================                                      
     THE COMPUTATION FORMAT IS NOT INTENTED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE    
     EXFOR FORMAT, RATHER THE TWO ARE COMPLEMENTARY. THE EXFOR FORMAT  
     CONTAINS MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAN CAN BE INCLUDED IN COMPUTATION
     FORMATS AND THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSULTED AND USED DURING  
     EVALUATION. THE COMPUTATION FORMAT IS ONLY INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY   
     USE OF THE DATA DURING EVALUATION, OR OTHER APPLICATIONS.         
                                                                       
     RELATIONSHIP TO ENDF/B                                            
     ======================                                            
     IT IS ASSUMED THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR USES OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE  
     TO PREPARE DATA FOR SUBSEQUENT USE IN EVALUATION AND/OR TO COMPARE
     AVAILABLE EVALUATED AND EXPERIMENTAL DATA. AS SUCH THE COMPUTATION
     FORMAT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ALLOW DATA TO BE REDUCED TO A FORM IN 
     WHICH DATA ARE CLASSIFIED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO ENDF/B DATA.     
                                                                       
     IN PARTICULAR THE EXFOR CLASSIFICATION OF DATA BY THE EXFOR       
     KEYWORD REACTION (OR ISO-QUANT, ETC.) IS REPLACED BY CLASSIFYING  
     THE DATA BY (1) PROJECTILE, (2) TARGET - ZA, (3) TYPE OF DATA -   
     ENDF/B - MF, (4) REACTION - ENDF/B MT. IN ADDITION THE STANDARD   
     UNITS USED BY THE TRANSLATION PROGRAM WERE SELECTED TO BE THE     
     SAME AS THE UNITS USED BY ENDF/B (E.G., EV, BARNS, ETC.).         
                                                                       
     THE RESULT OF PUTTING DATA INTO THE COMPUTATION FORMAT IS THAT IT 
     IS EASY TO DECIDE IF THE DATA IS COMPARABLE TO EVALUATED DATA     
     (E.G. SAME ZA, MF, MT) AND ONCE IT IS DECIDED THAT DATA IS        
     COMPARABLE, EVALUATION AND/OR COMPARISON IS SIMPLIFIED BECAUSE THE
     DATA IS IN THE SAME UNITS AS ENDF/B (E.G., EV VS. BARNS).         
                                                                       
     EXTENSIONS OF ENDF/B CONVENTIONS                                  
     ================================                                  
     FOR ALL TYPES OF DATA WHICH ARE PHYSICALLY COMPARABLE TO DATA     
     WHICH CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE ENDF/B DATA THIS PROGRAM USING THE   
     ENDF/B DEFINITIONS OF (1) TYPE OF DATA - ENDF/B MF, (2) REACTION -
     ENDF/B MT. FOR EXAMPLE ALL CROSS SECTIONS (MF=3), ANGULAR (MF=4)  
     AND ENERGY (MF=5) AND DOUBLE DIFFERENTIAL (MF=6) DISTRIBUTIONS    
     DATA ARE TRANSLATED TO MF =3 TO 6. SIMILARLY FOR SIMPLE REACTIONS 
     SUCH AS TOTAL (MT=1), ELASTIC (MT=2), ETC. THE DATA ARE TRANSLATED
     TO THE CORRESPONDING ENDF/B MT.                                   
                                                                       
     SINCE MANY TYPES OF DATA WHICH APPEAR IN EXFOR DO NOT HAVE A ONE  
     TO ONE CORRESPONDENCE TO DATA WHICH APPEARS IN ENDF/B THE ENDF/B  
     CLASSIFICATION OF TYPE OF DATA (MF) AND REACTION (MT) HAVE BEEN   
     EXTENDED TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL TYPES OF DATA AND REACTIONS TO BE    
     TRANSLATED (E.G., DEFINE MF NUMBERS FOR RATIOS, DEFINE MT NUMBERS 
     FOR (N,NP)+(N,NA)).                                               
                                                                       
     THE ENDF/B MF IS A 2 DIGIT NUMBER AND THE MT IS A 3 DIGIT NUMBER. 
     IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT MF HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO 3 DIGITS AND THE
     MT HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO 4 DIGITS. THESE EXTENSIONS ALLOW THE USER 
     THE FLEXIBILITY TO TRANSLATE VIRTUALLY ANY EXFOR DATA TO A FIXED  
     SET OF UNITS AND COLUMN ORDER FOR SUBSEQUENT USE IN APPLICATIONS. 
                                                                       
     SOME EXTENSIONS OF MF AND MT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED (FOR,  
     DETAILS SEE THE INPUT DICTIONARIES DESCRIBED BELOW) AND IF AT ALL 
     POSSIBLE THESE CONVENTIONS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE USER. THE    
     USER HAS THE FLEXIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING ANY CONVENTIONS THAT MAY 
     BE REQUIRED TO MEET HIS OR HER NEEDS, BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS THE  
     RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER TO PROPERLY INTERPRET AND USE THE      
     TRANSLATED DATA.                                                  
                                                                       
     DIRECT COMPARISON TO ENDF/B DATA                                  
     ================================                                  
     ALTHOUGH THE ENDF/B CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM OF MF AND MT IS USED FOR
     TRANSLATION, GENERALLY VERY LITTLE OF THE EXFOR DATA IS DIRECTLY  
     COMPARABLE TO ENDF/B DATA. GENERALLY CROSS SECTIONS (MF=3) ARE    
     DIRECTLY COMPARABLE. HOWEVER, IT MUST BE REALIZED THAT ANGULAR    
     (MF=4) AND ENERGY (MF=5) AND DOUBLE DIFFERENTIAL (MF=6) DATA ARE  
     GIVEN IN ENDF/B IN A NORMALIZED (I.E., NORMALIZED TO UNITY WHEN   
     INTERGRATED) FORM, WHEREAS DATA IN EXFOR ARE GENERALLY GIVEN IN AN
     UNNORMALIZED FORM (E.G.,ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS IN BARNS/STERADIAN).
                                                                       
     AFTER THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN USED TO TRANSLATE EXFOR DATA TO THE   
     COMPUTATION FORMAT THE USER MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DATA DIRECTLY     
     COMPARABLE TO THE CORRESPONDING ENDF/B DATA BY EITHER,            
     (1) NORMALIZING THE DATA IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT, OR,           
     (2) CONVERTING ENDF/B DATA TO UNNORMALIZED FORM.                  
     THIS INVOLVES SELECTING AN INTGRATED CROSS SECTION AS A STANDARD  
     TO USE FOR THE COMPARISON (E.G., FOR A 14.2 MEV ELASTIC ANGULAR   
     DISTRIBUTION USE THE 14.2 MEV ENDF/B ELASTIC CROSS SECTION).      
                                                                       
     SINCE THE SELECTION OF A STANDARD TO USE FOR COMPARISON IN HIGHLY 
     APPLICATION DEPENDENT IT HAS BEEN DECIDED THAT IT IS BETTER TO USE
     THIS PROGRAM TO TRANSLATE DATA EXACTLY AS GIVEN IN EXFOR (EXCEPT  
     FOR CONVERSION TO A STANDARD SET OF UNITS) AND TO ALLOW THE USER  
     TO SUBSEQUENTLY SELECT A STANDARD FOR RENORMALIZATION.            
                                                                       
     CONTROL OF TRANSLATION                                            
     ======================                                            
     THE USER HAS COMPLETE CONTROL OVER WHAT DATA IS TRANSLATED, WHERE 
     GIVEN TYPES OF DATA APPEAR IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT AND THE UNITS
     OF THE DATA IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT.                            
                                                                       
     THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY USING THREE DICTIONARIES WHICH CONTROL    
     THE TRANSLATION. ALL THREE OF THESE DICTIONARIES ARE DISTRIBUTED  
     WITH THIS PROGRAM. EACH DICTIONARY IS A SIMPLE CARD IMAGE FILE    
     WHICH MAY BE MODIFIED BY THE USER AT ANY TIME TO MEET SPECIFIC    
     NEEDS. THE THREE DICTIONARIES ARE,                                
                                                                       
     (1) EXFOR REACTION - PROJECTILE, MF, MT EQUIVALENCE               
         -----------------------------------------------               
         THIS DICTIONARY TELLS THE PROGRAM FOR EACH EXFOR REACTION     
         WHAT PROJECTILE, MF AND MT TO OUTPUT IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT
         (E.G.,(N,TOT) = NEUTRON, MF =3 (CROSS SECTION),MT =1 (TOTAL)).
         IF A REACTION READ FROM THE EXFOR FORMAT IS NOT FOUND IN THIS 
         DICTIONARY, OR THE ASSIGNED MF OR MT IS NOT POSITIVE THE EXFOR
         DATA WILL SIMPLY BE SKIPPED AND NOT TRANSLATED. USING THIS    
         DICTIONARY THE USER HAS CONTROL OVER WHICH DATA IS TRANSLATED 
         AND WHAT MF AND MT ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH EXFOR REACTION.       
                                                                       
     (2) EXFOR COLUMN TITLE - COMPUTATION FORMAT OUTPUT FIELD          
         ----------------------------------------------------          
         ONCE THE EXFOR REACTION HAS BEEN TRANSLATED AND ASSIGNED AN   
         EQUIVALENT MF AND MT THIS DICTIONARY TELLS THE PROGRAM WHERE  
         TO PLACE EACH EXFOR COLUMN IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT. THE     
         ASSIGNED MF NUMBER CAN BE USED TO OUTPUT AN EXFOR COLUMN      
         WITH THE SAME TITLE INTO DIFFERENT COLUMNS OF THE COMPUTATION 
         FORMAT BASED ON DIFFERENT MF NUMBERS. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR CROSS  
         SECTIONS (MF=3) THE USER MAY USE EN-MIN AND EN-MAX TO DEFINE  
         AN AVERAGE INCIDENT ENERGY TO BE OUTPUT IN THE FIRST FIELD    
         OF THE COMPUTATION FORMAT AND AN EQUIVALENT ENERGY UNCERTAINTY
         IN THE SECOND FIELD OF THE COMPUTATION FORMAT. ALTERNATIVELY  
         FOR RESONANCE INTEGRALS (MF=213) THE USER MAY DECIDE TO OUTPUT
         EN-MIN AND EN-MAX IN THE FIRST TWO FIELDS OF THE COMPUTATION  
         FORMAT TO DEFINE THE ENERGY RANGE OF THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL.  
                                                                       
         THERE ARE 8 OUTPUT FIELDS IN THE COMPUTATION FORMAT AND FOR   
         ANY GIVEN MF NUMBER THE USER MAY OUTPUT ANY EXFOR COLUMN      
         INTO ANY OF THESE FIELDS. ANY EXFOR TITLE WHICH IS NOT        
         ASSIGNED TO AN OUTPUT FIELD 1 TO 8 WILL BE IGNORED AND NOT    
         OUTPUT. THIS ALLOWS THE USER TO SELECTIVELY TRANSLATE PORTIONS
         OF EXFOR DATA TABLES TO MEET ANY GIVEN NEED. FOR EXAMPLE, BY  
         SIMPLY MODIFYING THIS DICTIONARY THE USER HAS CONTROL OVER    
         WHETHER AN EXFOR COLUMN DATA-ERR3 IS TRANSLATED OR IGNORED,   
         AND IF TRANSLATED THE USER HAS CONTROL OVER WHICH OF THE 8    
         COMPUTATION FORMAT DATA FIELDS DATA-ERR3 WILL APPEAR IN.      
                                                                       
     (3) EXFOR COLUMN UNITS - COMPUTATION FORMAT UNITS                 
         ---------------------------------------------                 
         THIS DICTIONARY TELLS THE PROGRAM HOW TO CONVERT EACH EXFOR   
         UNIT INTO STANDARD UNITS. AS DISTRIBUTED THIS DICTIONARY WILL 
         CONVERT ALL EXFOR UNITS TO ENDF/B COMPATIBLE UNITS. HOWEVER,  
         THE USER HAS THE OPTION TO CHANGE THIS DICTIONARY AT ANY TIME 
         TO OBTAIN ANY OUTPUT UNITS TO MEET HIS OR HER NEEDS. FOR      
         EXAMPLE IF THE USER WOULD LIKE OUTPUT IN MEV VS. MILLI-BARNS  
         INSTEAD OF EV VS. BARNS IT IS MERELY NECESSARY TO MODIFY THIS 
         DICTIONARY.                                                   
                                                                       
     OPERATIONS ON DATA                                                
     ==================                                                
     IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION DESCRIBED ABOVE EACH OF THE THREE  
     DICTIONARIES ALLOWS THE USER TO SELECT FROM A MENU OF OPERATIONS  
     WHICH MAY BE PERFORMED ON THE DATA (FOR A COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE 
     LIST OF AVAILABLE OPERATIONS SEE THE DICTIONARIES). FOR EXAMPLE,  
     THE REACTION DICTIONARY ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY THAT LEGENDRE  
     COEFFICENTS MAY BE RE-NORMALIZED, THE TITLE DICTIONARY ALLOWS THE 
     USER TO SPECIFY THAT EN-MIN AND EN-MAX ARE TO BE CONVERTED TO AN  
     AVERAGE ENERGY AND ASSOCIATED ENERGY UNCERTAINTY AND THE UNITS    
     DICTIONARY ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY THAT ANGLES SHOULD BE       
     CONVERTED TO COSINES.                                             
                                                                       
     THESE OPERATIONS ARE COMPLETELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE USER AND 
     BY SIMPLY MODIFYING THE DICTIONARIES THE USER CAN CONTROL WHETHER 
     OR NOT EACH OPERATION IS PERFORMED (E.G., IF YOU WANT TO OUTPUT   
     ANGLES INSTEAD OF COSINES MODIFY THE UNITS DICTIONARY BY REMOVING 
     THE OPTION TO CONVERT FROM ANGLE TO COSINE FROM THE EXFOR UNITS   
     ASEC, AMIN AND ADEG).

     ========================                                          
     AS DISTRIBUTED THE UNITS DICTIONARY WILL CONVERT ALL EXFOR UNITS  
     TO ENDF/B UNITS,                                                  
                                                                       
     EV         = ENERGY                                               
     BARNS      = CROSS SECTION

     IF THE USER WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN ANY OTHER OUTPUT UNITS IT IS     
     MERELY NECESSARY TO MODIFY THE UNITS DICTIONARY (SEE UNITS        
     DICTIONARY FOR DETAILS).                                          
                                                                       
     A LEARNING PROGRAM                                                
     ==================                                                
     AS DISTRIBUTED THE THREE TRANSLATION DICTIONARIES DO NOT CONTAIN  
     DEFINITIONS OF HOW TO TRANSLATE ALL EXFOR REACTIONS, TITLES AND   
     UNITS. AT THE PRESENT TIME THIS PROGRAM HAS ONLY BEEN USED TO     
     TRANSLATE A SMALL PORTION OF THE DATA INCLUDED IN THE EXFOR SYSTEM
     AND THE DICTIONARIES ONLY CONTAIN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO       
     TRANSLATE THE EXFOR DATA WHICH HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED TO DATE.      
                                                                       
     IT IS DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO TRY TO DEFINE TRANSLATION RULES  
     FOR ALL TYPES OF EXFOR DATA WITHOUT EXAMINING ACTUAL EXFOR DATA.  
     THEREFORE ONLY WHEN A NEW REACTION, TITLE OR UNIT IS ENCOUNTERED  
     DURING TRANSLATION WILL THE ACTUAL EXFOR DATA BE EXAMINED, A      
     DECISION MADE AS TO HOW TO BEST TRANSLATE THE DATA AND THE        
     DICTIONARIES UPDATED.                                             
                                                                       
     GENERALLY ONCE A GIVEN TYPE OF EXFOR DATA HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED AND
     THE DICTIONARIES UPDATED TO DEFINE HOW TO TRANSLATE THE DATA THE  
     SAME RULES CAN BE USED TO TRANSLATE ALL SIMILAR DATA. THEREFORE   
     OVER A PERIOD OF TIME USER EXPERIENCE WILL BE ACCUMULATED IN THE  
     TRANSLATION DICTIONARIES AND THE PROGRAM WILL LEARN TO PROPERLY   
     TRANSLATE MORE AND MORE TYPES OF EXFOR DATA.                      
                                                                       
     UNDEFINED EXFOR REACTIONS, TITLES AND UNITS                       
     ===========================================                       
     IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE USER TO DEFINE NEW TYPES OF EXFOR DATA AS  
     THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED DURING TRANSLATION THE OUTPUT REPORT FROM    
     THIS PROGRAM WILL INDICATE THE NUMBER OF EXFOR REACTIONS, TITLES  
     AND UNITS WHICH HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED DURING TRANSLATION WHICH ARE
     NOT DEFINED IN THE TRANSLATION DICTIONARIES. IN ADDITIONAL ALL    
     UNDEFINED REACTIONS, TITLES AND UNITS WILL BE WRITTEN TO OUTPUT   
     UNIT 4 (NEWX4).                                                   
                                                                       
     BASED ON COMPARISON TO THE REACTION, TITLE AND UNITS DICTIONARIES 
     IF AN EXFOR REACTION, TITLE OR UNITS IS ENCOUNTERED DURING        
     TRANSLATION THAT IS NOT DEFINED IN THE DICTIONARIES IT WILL BE    
     WRITTEN TO UNIT 4 (NEWX4). THIS INFORMATION IS WRITTEN IN A FORM  
     THAT CAN BE EASILY EDITED AND ADDED TO A TRANSLATION DICTIONARY.  
     AFTER UPDATING THE DICTIONARIES IF THIS PROGRAM IS THEN RUN A     
     SECOND TIME USING THE SAME EXFOR DATA ALL OF THE EXFOR DATA CAN   
     BE TRANSLATED.                                                    
                                                                       
     COMPUTATION FORMAT                                                
     ==================                                                
     THE COMPUTATION FORMAT USES A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND UNITS     
     WHICH ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ENDF/B. DATA IS CLASSIFIED BY (1) ZA    
     OF PROJECTILE, (2) ZA OF TARGET, (3) METASTABLE STATE OF TARGET,  
     (4) MF - TYPE OF DATA, (5) MT - REACTION, (6) METASTABLE STATE    
     OF RESIDUAL NUCLEUS. TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE DATA THE FIRST 
     AUTHOR AND YEAR AND THE EXFOR ACCESSION AND SUB-ACCESSION NUMBER  
     ARE INCLUDED IN THE FORMAT. IN ADDITION FIELDS ARE ASSIGNED TO    
     DEFINE THE STATUS OF THE EXFOR DATA (E.G., S = SUPERCEDED),       
     WHETHER DATA IS IN THE LABORATORY OR CENTER-OF-MASS FRAME OF      
     REFERENCE AND THE PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LAST 2 OUTPUT      
     FIELDS (LVL = LEVEL ENERGY, HL = HALF-LIFE). FINALLY THE FORMAT   
     INCLUDES 8 FIELDS INTO WHICH THE USER MAY OUTPUT DATA (E.G., DATA,
     INCIDENT ENERGY, COSINE, UNCERTAINTIES, ETC.).

     PRECISION OF THE 8 DATA FIELDS                                    
     ==============================                                    
     IF WRITTEN IN NORMAL FORMAT E9.2 FORMAT THE OUTPUT FROM THIS      
     THIS PROGRAM WOULD GIVE DATA TO ONLY 2 OR 3 DIGITS OF ACCURACY,   
     DEPENDING ON THE COMPUTER USED (E.G., 0.23E+02 OR 2.34E+01), WHICH
     IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR MANY APPLICATIONS (E.G., ENERGY OF CROSS    
     SECTION POINTS IN THE RESONANCE REGION).                          
                                                                       
     IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM THIS PROGRAM WILL OUTPUT DATA IN   
     A SPECIAL, FORMAT COMPATIBLE FORMAT TO ALLOW UP TO 7 DIGITS OF    
     ACCURACY (I.E.,MORE THAN THE FULL WORD ACCURACY OF IBM COMPUTERS).
                                                                       
     NUMBERS BETWEEN 0.01 AND LESS THAN 10 MILLION WILL BE OUTPUT IN F 
     (RATHER THAN E FORMAT). FOR EXAMPLE, THE ENERGY 12.3456 KEV WILL  
     BE OUTPUT AS 123456.0. NUMBERS LESS THAN 0.01 OR GREATER THAN     
     10 MILLION WILL BE OUTPUT IN E FORMAT, BUT WITHOUT AS E AND AN    
     EXPONENT OF 1 OR 2 DIGITS. FOR EXAMPLE 14.123 MEV WILL BE OUTPUT  
     AS 1.4123+7                                                       
                                                                       
     THESE OUTPUT CONVENTIONS HAVE BEEN USED FOR MANY YEARS WITH ENDF/B
     RELATED PROGRAMS AND HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE FORTRAN COMPATIBLE FOR
     USE ON VIRTUALLY ANY COMPUTER. FOR EXAMPLE, ANY FORTRAN PROGRAM   
     WHICH IS WRITTEN TO READ THIS DATA USING AN E9.2 FORMAT WILL READ 
     THE DATA PROPERLY WHETHER THE DATA IS ACTUALLY IN E OR F FORMAT.  
                                                                       
     GENERALLY MAINTAINING HIGH PRECISION IN THE DATA IS MOST IMPORTANT
     FOR THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE, PARTICULARLY INCIDENT ENERGY. SINCE 
     WE DO NOT EXPECT VERY NARROW RESONANCE STRUCTURE BELOW 0.01 EV OR 
     ABOVE 10 MEV GENERALLY THESE OUTPUT CONVENTIONS WILL MAINTAIN THE 
     ACCURACY OF THE EXFOR DATA TO MEET REQUIREMENTS.

     ==============================================                    
     THE USER MAY USE THE TITLE DICTIONARY TO OUTPUT ANY EXFOR COLUMN  
     INTO ANY COMPUTATION FORMAT DATA FIELD. AS DISTRIBUTED THE TITLE  
     DICTIONARY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF CONVENTIONS WHICH IF AT ALL       
     POSSIBLE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THE USERS. THE GENERAL DEFINITIONS 
     OF THE 8 COMPUTATION FORMAT DATA FIELDS ARE,

     THE PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF EACH FIELD IS DEFINED BY THE ASSIGNED
     MF NUMBER. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR MF =3 (CROSS SECTIONS), COLUMNS 1 AND 
     2 CONTAIN THE INCIDENT PROJECTILE ENERGY AND ITS UNCERTAINTY IN   
     EV, RESPECTIVELY AND COLUMNS 3 - 4 CONTAIN THE CROSS SECTION AND  
     ITS UNCERTAINTY IN BARNS, RESPECTIVELY AND COLUMNS 7 AND 8 MAY    
     CONTAIN A LEVEL ENERGY AND ITS UNCERTAINTY IN EV OR A HALF-LIFE   
     AND ITS UNCERTAINTY IN SECONDS.

     THE ABOVE CONVENTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR MOST TYPES OF DATA      
     IN THE ENDF/B SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THIS PROGRAM TO TRANSLATE

     FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF DATA THE PROGRAM WILL CHECK IF ALL REQUIRED  
     FIELDS ARE DEFINED AND NON-BLANK. IF THEY ARE NOT WARNING MESSAGES
     WILL BE PRINTED. IF THE DATA FIELD (FIELD 3) IS NOT DEFINED OR    
     BLANK THE DATA POINT WILL NOT BE OUTPUT. IF THE DATA FIELD IS NOT 
     DEFINED THIS USUALLY INDICATES AN ERROR IN THE EXFOR DATA. BLANK  
     DATA FIELDS ARE QUITE COMMON IN MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TABLES AND A    
     WARNING MAY OR MAY NOT INDICATE AN ERROR (CHECK THE EXFOR DATA TO

     THE PROGRAM CAN TRANSLATE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL EXFOR TABLES FOR,     
     (1) MULTIPLE REACTIONS FOLLOWING THE EXFOR KEYWORD REACTION       
         (ISO-QUANT, ETC.) WITH EACH REACTION IDENTIFIED BY A CHARACTER
         IN COLUMN 11.                                                 
     (2) SINGLE REACTIONS WITH MULTIPLE COMMON FIELDS EACH IDENTIFIED  
         BY A CHARACTER IN THE ELEVENTH COLUMN OF EACH FIELD.          
     (3) THE OLD ISO-QUANT, ETC. CONVENTION OF REACTIONS SEPARATED BY  
         COMMAS, E.G., ((90-TH-232,NG)/(29-CU-0,NG)),(29-CU-0,NG))     
                                                                       
     TRANSLATION OF EXFOR REACTIONS                                    
     ==============================                                    
     NOT ALL EXFOR REACTIONS (ISO-QUANT, ETC.) CAN BE TRANSLATED BY    
     THIS PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO TRANSLATE EACH REACTION THE PROGRAM WILL
     FIRST BREAK EACH REACTION INTO A SERIES OF SIMPLE REACTIONS AND   
     REMOVE AND SAVE THE TARGET AND RESIDUAL ZA, E.G.,                 
                                                                       
     ((26-FE-56(N,G)26-FE-57-M1,,SIG)/(26-FE-56(N,G)26-FE-57-G,,SIG))  
                                                                       
     IS BROKEN DOWN TO DEFINE                                          
                                                                       
     ZA-TARGET = 26056 , ZA-RESIDUAL = 260571, REACTION = (N,G),SIG    
     ZA-TARGET = 26056 , ZA-RESIDUAL = 260570, REACTION = (N,G),SIG    
                                                                       
     (NOTE, RESIDUAL METASTABLE STATE FLAGS. SEE EXPLANATION BELOW).   
                                                                       
     THE PROGRAM WILL THEN DEFINE AN EQUIVALENT MF, MT FOR EACH        
     REACTION.                                                         
                                                                       
     THE PROGRAM WILL NEXT TRANSLATE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF            
     REACTIONS,                                                        
     (1) SIMPLE REACTIONS                                              
         (N,G),SIG                                                     
     (2) EQUIVALENT REACTIONS                                          
         ((N,G),SIG)=...ANYTHING ELSE....                              
         AFTER DECODING THE FIRST SIMPLE REACTION THE PROGRAM ASSUMES  
         THAT THE FIRST SIMPLE REACTION IS TRUELY EQUIVALENT TO THE    
         REMAINDER OF THE REACTION AND DEFINES ZA, MF AND MT BASED ON  
         THE FIRST SIMPLE REACTION.                                    
     (3) SIMPLE RATIOS                                                 
         ((N,G)M1/G,,SIG/RAT) OR ((N,G)M1,SIG)/((N,G)G,SIG)            
     (4) COMPLEX REACTIONS - ALL WITH THE SAME EQUIVALENT ZA           
         ((N,EL),WID,,G)*((N,G),WID)/((N,TOT),WID)                     
     (5) OTHER REACTIONS                                               
         (((N,G),SIG)/((N,G),SIG),(N,G),SIG))                          
         IF THE REACTION IS NOT ONE OF THE ABOVE TYPES THE PROGRAM WILL
         TRY TO USE THE ENTIRE EXFOR REACTION, INCLUDING TARGET AND    
         RESIDUAL ZA AND SEE IF IT IS DEFINED IN REACTION EQUIVALENT   
         DICTIONARY. IF AN MF, MT IS DEFINED FOR THE ENTIRE REACTION   
         THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE TARGET AND RESIDUAL ZA FROM THE FIRST
         SIMPLE REACTION TO TRANSLATE THE DATA. THIS LAST FORM MAY BE  
         USED TO INSURE THAT ALMOST ALL EXFOR REACTION CAN BE          
         TRANSLATED, REGARDLESS OF HOW COMPLICATED IT IS (FOR EXAMPLES 
         SEE REACTION DICTIONARY) HOWEVER THE USER SHOULD CAREFULLY    
         CHECK THE OUTPUT TO INSURE THAT THE DATA HAS BEEN TRANSLATED  
         AS INTENDED.                                                  
                                                                       
     THE ONLY REACTIONS THAT HAVE SO FAR BEEN FOUND THAT CANNOT BE     
     CORRECTLY TRANSLATED ARE RATIOS OF PRODUCTION CROSS SECTIONS,     
     E.G., (29-CU-0(P,X)26-FE-56)/(28-NI-0(P,X)26-FE-58)               
     BECAUSE RATIO DATA REQUIRES FIELDS 5 AND 6 FOR THE DENOMINATOR    
     MT AND ZA AND RATIO DATA REQUIRES FIELD 5 FOR THE PRODUCT ZA.     
     WHEN THIS CASE IS ENCOUNTERED THE PROGRAM WILL PRINT AN ERROR     
     MESSAGE AND OUTPUT THE DENOMINATOR MT AND ZA IN FIELDS 5 AND 6.   
     IN THIS CASE THE OUTPUT WILL IDENTIFY THE NUMERATOR AS ZA=29000,  
     MT=9001 AND THE DENOMINATOR AS ZA=28000, MT=9001. ONE SOLUTION    
     IS TO MODIFY THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM BY DEFINING TWO REACTIONS,
     E.G., MT = 8001 = (P,X) 26-FE-56 AND MT = 8002 = (P,X) 26-FE-58,  
     MODIFY THE NUMERATOR MT TO 8001 AND DENOMINATOR MT TO 8002 AND    
     THEN PROPERLY INTERPRETING THE DATA USING THESE DEFINITION IN ALL 
     APPLICATIONS (FOR EXAMPLES, SEE PROGRAM PLOTC4 INPUT DIRECTIONARY 
     FOR PROTON INDUCED REACTIONS).

     THIS PROGRAM WILL WRITE A REPORT ON UNIT 6 (OUTP) TO ALLOW THE    
     USER TO MONITOR THE TRANSLATION OF THE EXFOR DATA. IT IS EXTREMELY
     IMPORTANT THAT THE USER READ THIS REPORT AND NOT SIMPLY ASSUME    
     THAT ALL OF THE DATA HAS BEEN PROPERLY TRANSLATED.                
                                                                       
     AFTER IDENTIFYING EACH EXFOR ACCESSION, SUB-ACCESSION NUMBER,     
     ZA, MF, MT AND REACTION THE PROGRAM CAN PRINT TWO TYPES OF        
     MESSAGES,                                                         
                                                                       
     WARNING    = SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAS OCCURRED. THE USER SHOULD      
                  CAREFULLY CHECK TO INSURE THAT THE OUTPUT DATA HAS   
                  BEEN PROPERLY TRANSLATED.                            
     OPERATION  = ONE OF THE DEFINED REACTION, TITLE OR UNIT OPERATIONS
                  HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON THE DATA. THE USER SHOULD      
                  CAREFULLY CHECK TO INSURE THAT THE PROPER OPERATION  
                  HAS BEEN PERFORMED.                                  
                                                                       
     IF THE USER DOES NOT AGREE WITH HOW THE DATA HAS BEEN TRANSLATED  
     THE THREE DICTIONARIES MAY TO BE MODIFIED AND THE PROGRAM RE-RUN. 
     FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE PROGRAM PRINTS A WARNING THAT THE TITLE       
     DICTIONARY TELLS IT TO OUTPUT E-ERR1, E-ERR2, E-ERR3 ALL IN THE   
     SAME COMPUTATION FORMAT FIELD, FOLLOWED BY AN OPERATION THAT SAYS 
     THE PROGRAM WILL ONLY OUTPUT E-ERR1 AND IGNOR THE OTHER 2 EXFOR   
     FIELDS, IF THE USER WOULD RATHER OUTPUT E-ERR2 AND IGNOR E-ERR1   
     AND E-ERR3 IT IS MERELY NECESSARY TO MODIFY THE TITLE DICTIONARY  
     TO IGNOR E-ERR1 AND E-ERR3 AND SELECT E-ERR2 AND THEN RE-RUN THE  
     PROGRAM.                                                          
                                                                       
     METASTABLE STATE                                                  
     ================                                                  
     THE COMPUTATION FORMAT ALLOWS THE METASTABLE STATE OF THE TARGET  
     AND RESIDUAL NUCLEUS TO BE IDENTIFIED. FOR RATIO DATA METASTABLE  
     STATE OF BOTH NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR OF THE RATIO MAY BE       
     DEFINED.                                                          
                                                                       
     THE METASTABLE STATE OF THE TARGET IS IDENTIFIED IN COLUMN 12 AND 
     THE METASTABLE STATE OF THE RESIDUAL NUCLUES IN COLUMN 20. FOR    
     RATIO DATA THE METASTABLE STATE OF THE DENOMINATOR TARGET AND     
     RESIDUAL NUCLEUS ARE IDENTIFIED BY OUTPUT THE DENOMINATOR ZA AND  
     MT IN THE FORM ZA.M AND MT.M (E.G., 26056.9 AND 102.1). COLUMNS   
     12 AND 20 MAY CONTAIN CHARACTERS SUCH AS M, BUT TO MAINTAIN THE   
     EIGHT OUTPUT FIELDS IN STRICTLY NUMERICAL FORM THE DENOMINATOR    
     ZA.M AND MT.M WILL BE OUTPUT IN NUMERICAL FORM. THE POSSIBLE      
     CHARACTERS THAT MAY APPEAR IN COLUMNS 12 OR 20 AND THEIR NUMERICAL
     EQUIVALENTS USED WITH RATIO DENOMINATOR ZA AND MT INCLUDE,
