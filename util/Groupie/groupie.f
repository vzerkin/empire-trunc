C     AUTHORS MESSAGE
C     ---------------
C     THE REPORT DESCRIBED ABOVE IS THE LATEST PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION
C     FOR THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER, THE COMMENTS BELOW SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
C     THE LATEST DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING ALL RECENT IMPROVEMENTS. PLEASE
C     READ ALL OF THESE COMMENTS BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION, PARTICULARLY
C     THE COMMENTS CONCERNING MACHINE DEPENDENT CODING.
C
C     AT THE PRESENT TIME WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP A SET OF COMPUTER
C     INDEPENDENT PROGRAMS THAT CAN EASILY BE IMPLEMENTED ON ANY ONE
C     OF A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPUTERS. IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN THIS PROJECT
C     IT WOULD BE APPECIATED IF YOU WOULD NOTIFY THE AUTHOR OF ANY
C     COMPILER DIAGNOSTICS, OPERATING PROBLEMS OR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO
C     IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM. HOPEFULLY, IN THIS WAY FUTURE VERSIONS OF
C     THIS PROGRAM WILL BE COMPLETELY COMPATIBLE FOR USE ON YOUR
C     COMPUTER.
C
C     PURPOSE
C     -------
C     THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CALCULATE ANY COMBINATION OF
C     THE FOLLOWING QUANTITIES FROM LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE TABULATED
C     CROSS SECTIONS IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT
C
C     (1) UNSHIELDED GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS
C     (2) BONDARENKO SELF-SHIELDED GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS
C     (3) MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS
C
C     IN THE FOLLOWING FOR SIMPLICITY THE ENDF/B TERMINOLOGY--ENDF/B
C     TAPE--WILL BE USED. IN FACT THE ACTUAL MEDIUM MAY BE TAPE, CARDS,
C     DISK OR ANY OTHER MEDIUM.
C
C     ENDF/B FORMAT
C     -------------
C     THIS PROGRAM ONLY USES THE ENDF/B BCD OR CARD IMAGE FORMAT (AS
C     OPPOSED TO THE BINARY FORMAT) AND CAN HANDLE DATA IN ANY VERSION
C     OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT (I.E., ENDF/B-I, II,III, IV OR V FORMAT).
C
C     IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE DATA IS CORRECTLY CODED IN THE ENDF/B
C     FORMAT AND NO ERROR CHECKING IS PERFORMED. IN PARTICULAR IT IS
C     ASSUMED THAT THE MAT, MF AND MT ON EACH CARD IS CORRECT. SEQUENCE
C     NUMBERS (COLUMNS 76-80) ARE IGNORED ON INPUT, BUT WILL BE
C     CORRECTLY OUTPUT ON ALL CARDS. THE FORMAT OF SECTION MF=1, MT=451
C     AND ALL SECTIONS OF MF= 3 MUST BE CORRECT. THE PROGRAM COPIES ALL
C     OTHER SECTION OF DATA AS HOLLERITH AND AS SUCH IS INSENSITIVE TO
C     THE CORRECTNESS OR INCORRECTNESS OF ALL OTHER SECTIONS.
C
C     ALL FILE 3 CROSS SECTIONS THAT ARE USED BY THIS PROGRAM MUST BE
C     LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE IN ENERGY AND CROSS SECTION (ENDF/B
C     INTERPOLATION LAW 2). FILE 3 BACKGROUND CROSS SECTIONS MAY BE MADE
C     LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE USING PROGRAM LINEAR (UCRL-50400, VOL. 17,
C     PART A). THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTION MAY BE ADDED TO THE BACKGROUND
C     CROSS SECTIONS USING PROGRAM RECENT (UCRL-50400, VOL. 17, PART B).
C     IF THIS PROGRAM FINDS THAT THE FILE 3 CROSS SECTIONS ARE NOT
C     LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE THIS PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE EXECUTION.

C     ------------------
C     IF ENDF/B FORMATTED OUTPUT IS REQUESTED ENTIRE EVALUATIONS ARE
C     OUTPUT, NOT JUST THE MULTI-GROUPED FILE 3 CROSS SECTIONS, E.G.
C     ANGULAR AND ENERGY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
C
C     DOCUMENTATION
C     -------------
C     THE FACT THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS OPERATED ON THE DATA IS DOCUMENTED
C     BY THE ADDITION OF THREE COMMENT CARDS AT THE END OF EACH
C     HOLLERITH SECTION TO DESCRIBE THE GROUP STRUCTURE AND WEIGHTING
C     SPECTRUM, E.G.
C
C     ********************** PROGRAM GROUPIE (2015-2) ***************
C     UNSHIELDED GROUP AVERAGES USING   69 GROUPS (WIMS)
C     MAXWELLIAN, 1/E AND FISSION WEIGHTING SPECTRUM
C
C     THE ORDER OF ALL SIMILAR COMMENTS (FROM LINEAR, RECENT AND SIGMA1)
C     REPRESENTS A COMPLETE HISTORY OF ALL OPERATIONS PERFORMED ON
C     THE DATA.
C
C     THESE COMMENT CARDS ARE ONLY ADDED TO EXISTING HOLLERITH SECTIONS,
C     I.E., THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT CREATE A HOLLERITH SECTION. THE FORMAT
C     OF THE HOLLERITH SECTION IN ENDF/B-V DIFFERS FROM THE THAT OF
C     EARLIER VERSIONS OF ENDF/B. BY READING AN EXISTING MF=1, MT=451
C     IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF
C     THE ENDF/B FORMAT THE DATA IS IN. WITHOUT HAVING A SECTION OF
C     MF=1, MT=451 PRESENT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO
C     DETERMINE WHICH VERSION OF THE ENDF/B FORMAT THE DATA IS IN, AND
C     AS SUCH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM TO DETERMINE WHAT FORMAT
C     SHOULD BE USED TO CREATE A HOLLERITH SECTION.
C
C     REACTION INDEX
C     --------------
C     THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT USE THE REACTION INDEX WHICH IS GIVEN IN
C     SECTION MF=1, MT=451 OF EACH EVALUATION.
C
C     THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT UPDATE THE REACTION INDEX IN MF=1, MT=451.
C     THIS CONVENTION HAS BEEN ADOPTED BECAUSE MOST USERS DO NOT
C     REQUIRE A CORRECT REACTION INDEX FOR THEIR APPLICATIONS AND IT WAS
C     NOT CONSIDERED WORTHWHILE TO INCLUDE THE OVERHEAD OF CONSTRUCTING
C     A CORRECT REACTION INDEX IN THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IF YOU REQUIRE
C     A REACTION INDEX FOR YOUR APPLICATIONS, AFTER RUNNING THIS PROGRAM
C     YOU MAY USE PROGRAM DICTIN TO CREATE A CORRECT REACTION INDEX.
C
C     SECTION SIZE
C     ------------
C     SINCE THIS PROGRAM USES A LOGICAL PAGING SYSTEM THERE IS NO LIMIT
C     TO THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN ANY SECTION, E.G., THE TOTAL CROSS
C     SECTION MAY BE REPRESENTED BY 200,000 DATA POINTS.
C
C     SELECTION OF DATA
C     -----------------
C     THE PROGRAM SELECTS MATERIALS TO BE PROCESSED BASED EITHER ON
C     MAT (ENDF/B MAT NO.) OR ZA. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS UP TO 100 MAT OR
C     ZA RANGES TO BE SPECIFIED. THE PROGRAM WILL ASSUME THAT THE
C     ENDF/B TAPE IS IN EITHER MAT OR ZA ORDER, WHICHEVER CRITERIA IS
C     USED TO SELECT MATERIALS, AND WILL TERMINATE WHEN A MAT OR ZA
C     IS FOUND THAT IS ABOVE THE RANGE OF ALL REQUESTS.
C
C     ENERGY ORDER AND UNITS
C     ----------------------
C     ALL ENERGIES (FOR CROSS SECTIONS, WEIGHTING SPECTRUM OR GROUP
C     BOUNDARIES) MUST BE IN UNITS OF EV AND MUST BE IN ASCENDING
C     NUMERICAL ORDER.
C
C     ENERGY GRID
C     -----------
C     ALTHOUGH ALL REACTIONS MUST TO LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE, THEY DO NOT
C     ALL HAVE TO USE THE SAME ENERGY GRID. EACH REACTION CAN BE GIVEN
C     BY AN INDEPENDENT ENERGY GRID. THIS PROGRAM WILL PROCEED FROM
C     THE LOWEST TO HIGHEST ENERGY SELECTING EACH ENERGY INTERVAL OVER
C     WHICH ALL DATA, FOR ANY GIVEN CALCULATION, ARE ALL LINEARLY
C     INTERPOLABLE.
C
C     GROUP STRUCTURE
C     ---------------
C     THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO USE AN ARBITRARY ENERGY GROUP
C     STRUCTURE WHERE THE ENERGIES ARE IN EV AND ARE IN INCREASING
C     ENERGY ORDER. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GROUPS IS 1000.
C
C     THE USER MAY INPUT AN ARBITRARY GROUP STRUCTURE OR THE USER MAY
C     USE USE ONE OF THE SEVEN BUILT-IN GROUP STRUCTURES.
C     (0) 175 GROUP (TART STRUCTURE)
C     (1)  50 GROUP (ORNL STRUCTURE)
C     (2) 126 GROUP (ORNL STRUCTURE)
C     (3) 171 GROUP (ORNL STRUCTURE)
C     (4) 620 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, UP TO 18 MEV)
C     (5) 640 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, UP TO 20 MEV)
C     (6)  69 GROUP (WIMS STRUCTURE)
C     (7)  68 GROUP (GAM-I STRUCTURE)
C     (8)  99 GROUP (GAM-II STRUCTURE)
C     (9)  54 GROUP (MUFT STRUCTURE)
C    (10)  28 GROUP (ABBN STRUCTURE)
C    (11) 616 GROUP (TART STRUCTURE TO 20 MeV)

C    (14) 685 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, 1.0D-5 eV, UP TO 20 MEV)
C    (15) 666 GROUP (TART STRUCTURE TO 200 MeV)
C    (16) 725 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, 1.0D-5 eV, UP TO  60 MEV)
C    (17) 755 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, 1.0D-5 eV, UP TO 150 MEV)
C    (18) 765 GROUP (SAND-II STRUCTURE, 1.0D-5 eV, UP TO 200 MEV)
C
C     GROUP AVERAGES
C     --------------
C     THIS PROGRAM DEFINES GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS AS...
C
C               (INTEGRAL E1 TO E2) (SIGMA(E)*S(E)*WT(E)*DE)
C     AVERAGE = -----------------------------------------
C               (INTEGRAL E1 TO E2) (S(E)*WT(E)*DE)
C     WHERE...
C
C     AVERAGE  = GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTION
C     E1, E2   = ENERGY LIMITS OF THE GROUP
C     SIGMA(E) = ENERGY DEPENDENT CROSS SECTION FOR ANY GIVEN REACTION
C     S(E)     = ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM
C     WT(E)    = ENERGY DEPENDENT SELF-SHIELDING FACTOR.
C
C     ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM
C     -----------------------------------
C     THE ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM IS GIVEN BY AN ARBITRARY
C     TABULATED LINERLY INTERPOLABLE FUNCTION WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED
C     BY AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF POINTS. THIS ALLOWS THE USER TO
C     SPECIFY ANY DESIRED WEIGHTING SPECTRUM TO ANY GIVEN DEGREE OF
C     ACCURACY. REMEMBER THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ASSUME THAT THE SPECTRUM
C     IS LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE BETWEEN TABULATED POINTS. THEREFORE THE
C     USER SHOULD USE ENOUGH POINTS TO INSURE AN ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION
C     OF THE SPECTRUM BETWEEN TABULATED DATA POINTS.
C
C     THE PRESENT VERSION OF THE CODE HAS THREE BULIT-IN WEIGHTING
C     SPECTRA,
C
C     (1) CONSTANT
C     (2) 1/E
C     (3) MAXWELLIAN = E*EXP(-E/KT)/KT                (0.0 TO 4*KT)
C         1/E        = C1/E                           (4*KT TO 67 KEV)
C         FISSION    = C2*EXP(-E/WA)*SINH(SQRT(E*WB)) (ABOVE 67 KEV)
C
C         KT     = 0.253 EV (293 KELVIN)
C         WA     = 9.65D+5
C         WB     = 2.29D-6
C         C1, C2 = DEFINED TO MAKE SPECTRUM CONTINUOUS
C
C         FISSION SPECTRUM CONSTANTS FROM
C         A.F.HENRY, NUCLEAR REACTOR ANALYSIS, P. 11, MIT PRESS (1975)
C
C     UNSHIELDED GROUP AVERAGES
C     -------------------------
C     FOR UNSHIELDED AVERAGES THE SELF-SHIELDING FACTOR (WT(E)) IS SET
C     TO UNITY. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS UP TO 1000 GROUPS.
C
C     SELF-SHIELDED GROUP AVERAGES
C     ----------------------------
C     IF SELF-SHIELDED AVERAGES AND/OR MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS ARE
C     CALCULATED THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS UP TO 1000 GROUPS. SELF-SHIELDED
C     AVERAGES AND/OR MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS ARE CALCULATED FOR THE
C     TOTAL, ELASTIC, CAPTURE AND FISSION.
C
C     FOR THE TOTAL, ELASTIC, CAPTURE AND FISSION THE PROGRAM USES A
C     WEIGHTING FUNCTION THAT IS A PRODUCT OF THE ENERGY DEPENDENT
C     WEIGHTING SPECTRUM TIMES A BONDERENKO TYPE SELF-SHIELDING FACTOR.
C
C     WT(E) = S(E)/(TOTAL(E)+SIGMA0)**N
C
C     WHERE...
C
C     S(E)     - ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM (DEFINED BY
C                TABULATED VALUES AND LINEAR INTERPOLATION BETWEEN
C                TABULATED VALUES).
C     TOTAL(E) - ENERGY DEPENDENT TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR ONE MATERIAL
C                (DEFINED BY TABULATED VALUES AND LINEAR INTERPOLATION
C                BETWEEN TABULATED VALUES).
C     SIGMA0   - CROSS SECTION TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF ALL OTHER
C                MATERIALS AND LEAKAGE (DEFINED WITHIN EACH GROUP TO BE
C                A MULTIPLE OF THE UNSHIELDED TOTAL CROSS SECTION WITHIN
C                THAT GROUP OR POWERS OF 10 - INPUT OPTION).
C     N        - A POSITIVE INTEGER (0, 1, 2 OR 3).
C
C     THE PROGRAM WILL USE ONE ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM S(E)
C     AND 25 DIFFERENT BONDERENKO TYPE SELF-SHIELDING FACTORS (25 SIGMA0
C     AND N COMBINATIONS) TO DEFINE 25 DIFFERENT AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS,
C     FOR EACH REACTION, WITHIN EACH GROUP.
C
C     THE 25 WEIGHTING FUNCTIONS USED ARE....
C     (1)   - UNSHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS (N=0)
C     (2-22)- PARTIALLY SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS (N=1 ,VARIOUS SIGMA0)
C             THE VALUES OF SIGMA0 USED WILL BE EITHER,
C             (A) THE VALUES OF SIGMA0 THAT ARE USED VARY FROM 1024
C             TIMES THE UNSHIELDED TOTAL CROSS SECTIONS IN STEPS OF 1/2
C             DOWN TO 1/1024 TIMES THE UNSHIELDED TOTAL CROSS SECTION
C             (A RANGE OF OVER 1 MILLION, CENTERED ON THE UNSHIELDED
C             TOTAL CROSS SECTION WITHIN EACH GROUP).
C             (B) THE SAME CONSTANT VALUES OF SIGMA0 IN EACH GROUP. THE
C             VALUES OF SIGMA0 USED INCLUDE 40000, 20000, 10000, 7000,
C             4000, 2000, 1000, 700, 400, 200, 100, 70, 40, 20, 10, 7,
C             4, 2, 1, 0.7, 0.4 (A RANGE OF 100,000 SPANNING MORE THAN
C             THE RANGE OF SIGMA0 VALUES THAT MAY BE ENCOUNTERED IN
C             ACTUAL APPLICATIONS)
C     (23)  - TOTALLY SHIELDED FLUX WEIGHTED CROSS SECTION
C             (N=1, SIGMA0=0)
C     (24)  - TOTALLY SHIELDED CURRENT WEIGHTED CROSS SECTION
C             (N=2, SIGMA0=0)
C     (25)  - TOTALLY SHIELDED COSINE SQUARED WEIGHTED CROSS SECTION
C             (N=3, SIGMA0=0)
C
C     FOR ALL OTHER REACTIONS (EXCEPT TOTAL, ELASTIC, CAPTURE AND
C     FISSION) THE PROGRAM WILL USE THE ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING
C     SPECTRUM S(E) TO DEFINE THE UNSHIELDED (BONDERENKO N=0)
C     AVERAGED CROSS SECTION WITHIN EACH GROUP.
C
C     CALCULATION OF RESONANCE INTEGRALS
C     ----------------------------------
C     IN A PURE ELASTIC ISOTROPICALLY SCATTERING MATERIAL WITH A
C     CONSTANT CROSS SECTION THE SPECTRUM WILL BE 1/E AND THERE WILL
C     BE NO SELF-SHIELDING.
C
C     IN THIS CASE IF THE CROSS SECTION VARIES WITH ENERGY THE
C     SPECTRUM WILL STILL BE 1/E AND THE SELF-SHIELDING FACTOR WILL
C     BE EXACTLY 1/SIG-TOT(E) - WHERE SIG-TOT(E) = SIG-EL(E), SINCE
C     THERE IS ONLY SCATTERING.
C
C     IF WE HAVE AN INFINITELY DILUTE AMOUNT OF A MATERIAL UNIFORMLY
C     MIXED WITH A PURE ELASTIC ISOTROPICALLY SCATTERING MATERIAL WITH
C     A CONSTANT CROSS SECTION THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF THE RESONANCE
C     INTEGRAL CAN BE USED TO DEFINE REACTION RATES FOR EACH REACTION.
C
C     THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL IS DEFINED AS,
C
C     RI      = (INTEGRAL E1 TO E2) (SIGMA(E)*S(E)*WT(E)*DE)
C
C     WHERE NORMALLY,
C     S(E)    = 1/E
C     WT(E)   = 1    - NO SELF-SHIELDING
C
C     FROM THE ABOVE DEFINITION OF GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS THE
C     RESONANCE INTEGRAL IS,
C
C     RI      = AVERAGE * (INTEGRAL E1 TO E2) (S(E)*WT(E)*DE)
C
C     FOR A 1/E SPECTRUM AND NO SELF-SHIELDING THIS REDUCES TO,
C
C     RI      = AVERAGE* LOG(E2/E1)
C
C     IN ANY OTHER SITUATION, INCLUDING ABSORPTION AND/OR ENERGY
C     DEPENDENT CROSS SECTIONS, THE SPECTRUM WILL NOT BE 1/E -
C     ABSORPTION WILL TEND TO DECREASE THE SPECTRUM PROGRESSIVELY
C     MORE AT LOWER ENERGIES - ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE CROSS SECTION
C     WILL LEAD TO SELF-SHIELDING.
C
C     HERE WE WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO PERFORM A DETAILED SPECTRUM
C     CALCULATION TO ACCOUNT FOR ABSORPTION.
C
C     HOWEVER, WE WILL EXTEND THE DEFINITION OF THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL
C     TO ACCOUNT FOR SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS BY ALLOWING FOR INCLUSION
C     OF SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS IN THE DEFINITION OF GROUP AVERAGES
C     AND THEN DEFINING THE RESONANCE INTEGRAL AS,
C
C     RI      = AVERAGE* LOG(E2/E1)
C
C     IN ORDER TO CALCULATE RESONANCE INTEGRALS YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE
C     STEPS,
C
C     1) SELECT A 1/E SPECTRUM - ON FIRST LINE OF INPUT PARAMETERS.
C     2) SELECT THE ENERGY BOUNDARIES - NORMALLY ONLY 1 GROUP FROM
C        0.5 EV UP TO 20 MEV - HOWEVER, YOU ARE FREE TO SELECT ANY
C        ENERGY RANGE THAT YOU WISH - YOU MAY EVEN SELECT MORE THAN
C        1 GROUP MERELY BY SPECIFYING MORE THAN 1 GROUP AS INPUT -
C        THIS CAN BE USED TO DEFINE THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RESONANCE
C        INTEGRAL FROM INDIVIDUAL ENERGY RANGES.
C     3) SELECT THIS OPTION FOR THE UNSHIELDED AND/OR SHIELDED OUTPUT
C        LISTING - ON THE SECOND LINE OF INPUT PARAMETERS.
C
C     WHEN THIS OPTION IS USED THE PROGRAM WILL CALCULATE GROUP AVERAGED
C     CROSS SECTIONS - AS DEFINED ABOVE - PRIOR TO OUTPUT THE RESULTS
C     WILL MERELY BE MULTIPLIED BY THE WIDTH OF THE GROUP ASSUMING YOU
C     HAVE SELECTED A 1/E SPECTRUM - THERE IS NO CHECK ON THIS - THE
C     PROGRAM MERELY MULTIPLIES THE GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS BY,
C
C     LOG(E2/E1) - WHERE E2 AND E1 ARE THE GROUP ENERGY BOUNDARIES.
C
C     WARNING - IT IS UP TO YOU TO INSURE THAT YOU FOLLOW EXACTLY THE
C               STEPS OUTLINED ABOVE IF YOU WISH TO OBTAIN MEANINGFUL
C               RESULTS.
C
C     NOTE - OUTPUT IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT IS ALWAYS GROUP AVERAGED CROSS
C            SECTIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU ASK FOR AVERAGED CROSS
C            SECTIONS OR RESONANCE INTEGRALS - THIS IS BECAUSE DATA IN
C            THE ENDF/B FORMAT IS EXPLICITLY DEFINED TO BE CROSS
C            SECTIONS.
C
C            RESONANCE INTEGRAL OUTPUT CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED IN THE
C            LISTING FORMATS.
C
C     MINIMUM TOTAL CROSS SECTION TREATMENT
C     -------------------------------------
C     SINCE THE BONDARENKO SELF-SHIELDING DEPENDS ON 1/TOTAL CROSS
C     SECTION, THE ALGORITHM WILL BECOME NUMERICALLY UNSTABLE IF THE
C     TOTAL CROSS SECTION IS NEGATIVE (AS OCCURS IN MANY ENDF/B
C     EVALUATIONS). IF THE TOTAL IS LESS THAN SOME MINIMUM ALLOWABLE
C     VALUE (DEFINE BY OKMIN, PRESENTLY 1 MILLI-BARN) AN ERROR MESSAGE
C     WILL BE PRINTED AND FOR THE SELF-SHIELDING CALCULATION ALL ENERGY
C     INTERVALS IN WHICH THE TOTAL IS LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WILL BE
C     IGNORED.
C
C     NOTE, FOR THE UNSHIELDED CALCULATIONS ALL CROSS SECTIONS WILL BE
C     CONSIDERED WHETHER THEY ARE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. THEREFORE IF
C     THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION IS NEGATIVE OR LESS THAN THE MINIMUM
C     VALUE THERE MAY BE AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE UNSHIELDED AND
C     THE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS. IF THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION IS
C     NEGATIVE AND SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS ARE CALCULATED THE
C     PROGRAM WILL PRINT AN ERROR MESSAGE INDICATING THAT THE SELF-
C     SHIELDED RESULTS ARE UNRELIABLE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED. THEREFORE
C     IN THIS CASE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO MODIFY THE UNSHIELDED
C     RESULTS TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECT OF NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS, SINCE
C     THE UNSHIELDED RESULTS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHICH TRULY REFLECT THE
C     ACTUAL INPUT.
C
C     RESOLVED RESONANCE REGION
C     -------------------------
C     IN THE RESOLVED RESONANCE REGION (ACTUALLY EVERYWHERE BUT IN THE
C     UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION) THE CROSS SECTIONS OUTPUT BY LINEAR-
C     RECENT-SIGMA1 WILL BE ACTUAL ENERGY DEPENDENT CROSS SECTIONS AND
C     THE CALCULATIONS BY THIS PROGRAM WILL YIELD ACTUAL SHIELDED AND
C     UNSHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS.
C
C     UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION
C     ---------------------------
C     IN THE UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION PROGRAM RECENT USES THE
C     UNRESOLVED RESONANCE PARAMETERS TO CALCULATE INFINITELY DILUTE
C     AVERAGE CROSS SECTIONS. THIS PROGRAM WILL MERELY READ THIS
C     INFINITELY DILUTE DATA AS IF IT WERE ENERGY DEPENDENT DATA AND
C     GROUP AVERAGE IT. AS SUCH THIS PROGRAM WILL PRODUCE THE CORRECT
C     UNSHIELDED CROSS SECTION IN THE UNRESOLVED RESONANCE REGION, BUT
C     IT WILL NOT PRODUCE THE CORRECT SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS.
C
C     ACCURACY OF RESULTS
C     -------------------
C     ALL INTEGRALS ARE PERFORMED ANALYTICALLY. THEREFORE NO ERROR IS
C     INTRODUCED DUE TO THE USE OF TRAPAZOIDAL OR OTHER INTEGRATION
C     SCHEME. THE TOTAL ERROR THAT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE RESULTING
C     AVERAGES IS JUST THAT DUE TO THE ERROR IN THE CROSS SECTIONS
C     AND ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM. GENERALLY SINCE THE
C     THE ENERGY DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM APPEARS IN BOTH THE
C     NUMERATOR AND THE DENOMINATOR THE AVERAGES RAPIDLY BECOME
C     INSENSITIVE TO THE WEIGHTING SPECTRUM AS MORE GROUPS ARE USED.
C     SINCE THE WEIGHTING SPECTRUM IS LOADED IN THE PAGING SYSTEM THE
C     USER CAN DESCRIBE THE SPECTRUM TO ANY REQUIRED ACCURACY USING
C     ANY NUMBER OF ENERGY VS. SPECTRUM PAIRS.
C
C     MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS
C     ---------------------
C     MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS ARE CALCULATED FOR THE TOTAL, ELASTIC,
C     CAPTURE AND FISSION REACTIONS. WITH THE NUMBER OF GROUPS THAT
C     ARE NORMALLY USED (SEE BUILT IN GROUP STRUCTURES) ALL OTHER
C     REACTIONS RESULT IN A NEGLIGABLE AMOUNT OF SELF-SHIELDING. AS
C     SUCH THEIR EQUIVALENT BAND CROSS SECTION WILL MERELY BE THEIR
C     UNSHIELDED VALUE WITHIN EACH BAND.
C
C     FOR ANY GIVEN EVALUATION, WITHIN ANY GIVEN GROUP THIS PROGRAM
C     WILL GENERATE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BANDS REQUIRED WITHIN THAT
C     GROUP. AS OUTPUT TO THE COMPUTER READABLE DISK FILE THE BAND
C     PARAMETERS FOR EACH EVALUATION WILL BE FORMATTED TO HAVE THE
C     SAME NUMBER OF BANDS IN ALL GROUPS (WITH ZERO WEIGHT FOR SOME
C     BANDS WITHIN ANY GROUP). THE USER MAY DECIDE TO HAVE OUTPUT
C     EITHER WITH THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BANDS REQUIRED FOR EACH
C     EVALUATION (E.G. 2 BANDS FOR HYDROGEN AND 4 BANDS FOR U-233) OR
C     THE SAME NUMBER OF BANDS FOR ALL EVALUATIONS (E.G. 4 BANDS FOR
C     BOTH HYDROGEN AND U-233).
C
C     FOR 2 OR FEWER BANDS THE PROGRAM USES AN ANALYTIC EXPRESSION
C     TO DEFINE ALL MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS. FOR MORE THAN 2 BANDS THE
C     PROGRAM PERFORMS A NON-LINEAR FIT TO SELECT THE MULTI-BAND
C     PARAMETERS THAT MINIMIZE THE MAXIMUM FRACTIONAL ERROR AT ANY
C     POINT ALONG THE ENTIRE SELF-SHIELDING CURVE. THE NUMBER OF BANDS
C     REQUIRED WITHIN ANY GIVEN GROUP IS DEFINED BY INSURING THAT THE
C     MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS CAN BE USED TO ACCURATELY DEFINE SELF-
C     SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS ALONG THE ENTIRE SELF-SHIELDING CURVE
C     FROM SIGMA0 = 0 TO INFINITY. THE USER MAY DEFINE THE ACCURACY
C     REQUIRED.
C
C     ENDF/B FORMATTED UNSHIELDED AVERAGES
C     ------------------------------------
C     UNSHIELDED MULTI-GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS FOR ALL REACTIONS
C     MAY BE OBTAINED IN THE ENDF/B FORTRAN IN EITHER HISTOGRAM
C     (INTERPOLATION LAW 1) OR LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE (INTERPOLATION
C     LAW 2) FORM. SEE INPUT BELOW FOR DETAILS.
C
C     MIXTURES OF MATERIALS AND RESONANCE OVERLAP
C     -------------------------------------------
C     THE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUENTS
C     OF ANY MIXTURE CAN BE CALCULATED BY THIS PROGRAM BY REALIZING THAT
C     THIS PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY ONLY USES THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION AS A
C     WEIGHTING FUNCTION TO ACCOUNT FOR SELF-SHIELDING EFFECTS. FOR A
C     MIXTURE IT IS THEREFORE ONLY NECESSARY TO USE THE TOTAL CROSS
C     SECTION FOR THE MIXTURE IN PLACE OF THE ACTUAL TOTAL CROSS SECTION
C     FOR EACH CONSTITUENT AND TO RUN THIS PROGRAM. THIS CAN BE DONE BY
C     FIRST RUNNING PROGRAM MIXER TO CALCULATE THE ENERGY DEPENDENT
C     TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR ANY COMPOSITE MIXTURE. NEXT, SUBSTITUTE
C     THIS COMPOSITE TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THE ACTUAL TOTAL CROSS
C     SECTION OF EACH CONSTITUENT (IN EACH ENDF/B FORMATTED EVALUATION).
C     FINALLY, RUN THIS PROGRAM TO CALCULATE THE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS
C     SECTION FOR EACH CONSTITUENT, PROPERLY ACCOUNTING FOR RESONANCE
C     OVERLAP BETWEEN THE RESONANCES OF ALL OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE
C     MIXTURE. DURING THE SAME RUN THESE SELF-SHIELDED CROSS SECTIONS
C     CAN IN TURN BE USED TO CALCULATE FULLY CORRELATED MULT-BAND
C
C     MULTI-BAND PARAMETER OUTPUT FORMAT
C     ----------------------------------
C     FOR VERSIONS 92-2 AND LATER VERSIONS THE MULTI-BAND PARAMETERS
C     ARE OUTPUT IN A SIMPLE CHARACTER FORMAT, THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED
C     AND USED ON VIRTUALLY ANY COMPUTER.
C
C     THE BINARY FORMAT USED IN EARLIER VERSIONS OF THIS CODE IS NO
C     LONGER USED.

C     THIS ROUTINE IS DESIGNED TO COMPUTE SHIELDED AND
C     UNSHIELDED GROUP AVERAGED CROSS SECTIONS FOR TOTAL,
C     ELASTIC, CAPTURE AND FISSION CROSS SECTIONS. BOTH THE ENERGY
C     DEPENDENT WEIGHTING SPECTRUM AND ALL CROSS SECTIONS MUST BE LINEAR
C     INTERPOLABLE BETWEEN TABULATED VALUES. ALL INTEGRALS ARE
C     PERFORMED ANALYTICALLY.
C
C     ALTHOUGH ALL INTEGRALS ARE PERFORMED ANALYTICALLY WHEN PERFORMING
C     THE INTEGRAL (E1 TO E2) (SIGMAI(E)*S(E)/(SIGMAT(E)+SIGMAO)**N))
C     SPECIAL CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN THE TOTAL CROSS SECTION (SIGMAT)
C     IS CONSTANT OR ALMOST CONSTANT OVER ANY ENERGY INTERVAL OF
C     INTEGRATION. IN THIS CASE THE ANALYTICAL INTERGALS THAT ARE
C     OBTAINED CONTAIN A GREAT DEAL OF CROSS CANCELLATION OF TERMS. IN
C     ORDER TO ACCURATELY HANDLE THIS CASE AN EXPANSION IS USED TO
C     EVALUATE THE EXPRESSION...
C
C     (ALOG((1+R)/(1-R))-2.0*R)/(R**3)
C
C     WHERE R IS THE RATIO OF THE CHANGE IN TOTAL CROSS SECTION ACROSS
C     THE ENERGY INTERVAL TO TWICE THE AVERAGE TOTAL CROSS SECTION IN
C     THE INTERVAL....
C
C     R=(SIGMAT(E2)-SIGMAT(E1))/(SIGMAT(E2)+SIGMAT(E1))
C
C     DEFINING X=R**2 THE APPROPRIATE EXPANSION IS
C
C     2.0*(1/3+X/5+X**2/7+X**3/9+X**4/11+X**5/13+X**6/15+...
C
C     THIS EXPANSION IS TRUNCATED AFTER R**8 (ERROR OF ORDER R**10).
C     THEREFORE FOR ABS(R) LESS THAN 0.01 THIS EXPANSION WILL YIELD
