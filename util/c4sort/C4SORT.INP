Lines below '$* END' are not read by SORTC4. 
In the input above, ALIAS lines
instruct SORTC4 to treat data for the natural element as taken on a specified
isotop (in the example above data on natural Fe and Si will be denoted in C4 
file as if were measured on 56-Fe and 28-Si respectively). Conversion is only applied to MF and MT 
numbers following target specification. The above aliases have no effect on other 
elements, thus can be kept as an example.
