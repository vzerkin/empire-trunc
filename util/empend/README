C-M  ========================= 
C-M   
C-M  The EMPIRE output is processed and converted into ENDF  
C-M  format. The data found on the file can be entered into  
C-M  the output ENDF file directly, or else thay can be  
C-M  interpolated by fitting a cubic spline to the cross  
C-M  section points, corrected for the reaction thresholds  
C-M  and thinned to the specified tolerance.

C-M  Instructions: 
C-M  The filename to be processed and the output filename 
C-M  are requested from input. Next, the number of subin- 
C-M  tervals to be inserted in between the tabulated points 
C-M  is specified. The cross sections are interpolated  
C-M  using cubic spline interpolation. If zero is entered, 
C-M  no spline interpolation is performed. Finally, the 
C-M  thinning tolerance (%) is requested. Data points which 
C-M  can be reproduced from the neighbouring points by linear  
C-M  interpolation to within the specified tolerance are  
C-M  removed. Entering a negative value causes thinning to  
C-M  be suppressed.
