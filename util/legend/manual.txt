     PURPOSE
     -------
     CALCULATE LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE TABULATED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
     STARTING FROM DATA IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT. ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
     MAY BE DESCRIBED IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT IN ONE OF THREE WAYS.
     FOR EACH OF THESE THREE FORMS THE USER MAY CHOOSE (SEE, INPUT
     OPTIONS) TO EITHER COPY EACH TYPE OF DATA OR TO PROCESS IT AT
     AS FOLLOWS,

     (1) ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION IS ISOTROPIC AT ALL ENERGIES (LTT=0)
     -------------------------------------------------------------
     IN THIS CASE THE INPUT DATA DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ANGULAR
     DISTRIBUTIONS. A SECTION MERELY CONTAINS A FLAG TO INDICATE
     THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION IS ISOTROPIC AT ALL ENERGIES. IN THIS
     CASE THE SECTION IS OUTPUT IN EXACTLY THE SAME FORM IN WHICH IT
     WAS READ FROM THE INPUT.

     (2) ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS GIVEN BY LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS (LTT=1)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS ARE GIVEN AT A SERIES OF ENERGIES. AN
     INTERPOLATION LAW IS GIVEN BETWEEN ENERGIES. THE INTERPOLATION
     LAW BETWEEN ENERGIES IS COPIED AS INPUT (I.E., NO ATTEMPT IS
     MADE TO LINEARIZE THE VARIATION WITH ENERGY). FOR EACH ENERGY AT
     WHICH LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS ARE GIVEN A LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE
     ANGULAR DISITRIBUTION IS RECONSTRUCTED IN THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE
     THE COEFFICIENTS ARE GIVEN (I.E., CM OR LAB - NO ATTEMPT IS MADE
     TO CONVERT FROM ONE SYSTEM TO THE OTHER). A MAXIMUM OF 30 LEGENDRE
     COEFFICIENTS IS ALLOWED. REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF COEFFICIENTS
     INPUT THE PROGRAM WILL ONLY USE COEFFICIENTS UP TO THE LAST ORDER
     AT WHICH THE COEFFICIENTS ARE NON-ZERO (E.G. IF COEFFICIENTS P1
     THROUGH P12 ARE READ, BUT P9=P10=P11=P12=0.0, THE PROGRAM WILL
     ONLY USE COEFFICIENTS UP TO P8). IF OVER 30 NON-ZERO COEFFICIENTS
     ARE READ ONLY THE FIRST 30 WILL BE USED.

     (2) ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS IS TABULATED (LTT=2)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE GIVEN AT A SERIES OF ENERGIES. AN
     INTERPOLATION LAW IS GIVEN BETWEEN ENERGIES AND A SECOND
     INTERPOLATION LAW IS GIVEN AT EACH ENERGY TO INTERPOLATE BETWEEN
     THE POINTS IN EACH TABULATED DISTRIBUTION. AT EACH ENERGY THE
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION WILL BE CONVERTED TO LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE
     FORM. THE INTERPOLATION BETWEEN ENERGIES IS OUTPUT EXACTLY AS
     INPUT. THE INTERPOLATION LAW AT EACH ENERGY IS OUTPUT TO INDICATE
     THE NOW LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION.

     POINT VALUES - NORMALIZED VS. UNNORMALIZED
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     THE VALUE OF AN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION AT ANY COSINE WILL BE
     CORRECTLY CALCULATED BY THIS CODE, BASED EITHER DIRECTLY ON THE
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION, OR ON THE SUM OF THE CONTRIBUTING LEGENDRE
     MOMENTS.

     ENDF/B ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE BY DEFINITION NORMALIZED WHEN
     INTEGRATED OVER COSINE. THEREFORE THIS CODE WILL NORMALIZE EACH
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION BEFORE IT IS OUTPUT. THE OUTPUT REPORT FROM
     THIS CODE WILL INDICATE THE NORMALIZATION FACTOR USED.

     THE REASON THAT AN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION MAY NOT BE NORMALIZED IS
     DUE TO THE APPROXIMATION OF CREATING LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE
     TABULATED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS - THE MORE ACCURATELY THIS IS
     DONE THE CLOSER THE NORMALIZATION FACTOR WILL BE TO UNITY. AS YOU
     DECREASE THE ALLOWABLE ERROR THE NORMALIZED VALUES WILL APPROACH
     THE CORRECT POINT VALUES CALCULATED BY THE CODE.

     SINCE THE DATA IS NORMALIZED PRIOR TO OUTPUT THE RESULTS IN THE
     ENDF/B FORMAT MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM VALUES REFERRED TO BE ERROR
     MESSAGES, ETC. PRINTED BY THE CODE DURING EXECUTION. IN ALL CASES
     THE VALUES PRINTED BY THE CODE IN ERROR MESSAGES, ETC. SHOULD BE
     CONSIDERED TO BE THE CORRECT VALUES AND THE OUTPUT TABULATED
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS APPROXIMATE DUE TO THE RE-NORMALIZATION -
     TO RE-ITERATE, THE OUTPUT TABULATED VALUES ARE APPROXIMATE DUE
     TO THE APPROXIMATIONS USED IN CONSTRUCTING LINEAR INTERPOLABLE
     ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS TO WITHIN SOME ALLOWABLE TOLERANCE.

     ELIMINATION OF NEGATIVE VALUES
     ------------------------------
     THE RECONSTRUCTED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION WILL BE TESTED AND IF IT
     IS NEGATIVE AT ONE OR MORE COSINES AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE OUTPUT
     AND BASED ON THE INPUT OPTION SELECTED ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN (SEE, INPUT OPTIONS),
     (1) NO CORRECTION
     (2) CHANGE INDIVIDUAL LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS (EACH BY LESS THAN
         1.0 PER-CENT) UNTIL THE RECONSTRUCTED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
         IS POSITIVE (MINIMUM MORE THAN 1 MILLI-BARN). THE ALLOWABLE
         PER-CENT CHANGE IN COEFFICIENTS AND MINIMUM CROSS SECTION CAN
         BE CHANGED BY INPUT.
     (3) CHANGE ALL LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS TO FORCE DISTRIBUTION TO BE
         POSITIVE (MINIMUM MORE THAN 1 MILLI-BARN). WITH THIS OPTION
         THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON THE AMOUNT THAT EACH COEFFICIENT
         IS CHANGED AND AS SUCH THIS OPTION SHOULD BE USED WITH
         CAUTION AND ONLY AS A LAST RESORT IF NO OTHER APPROACH CAN
         BE USED TO MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION POSITIVE.

     OUTPUT
     ------
     THE USER MAY REQUEST OUTPUT OF EITHER,
     (1) TABULATED VALUES - POSSIBLY CORRECTED TO ELIMINATE NEGATIVE
         VALUES. THE TABULATED DISTRIBUTION WILL BE NORMALIZED BEFORE
         OUTPUT.
     (2) LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS - POSSIBLY CORRECTED TO ELIMINATE
         NEGATIVE VALUES AND WITHOUT HIGHER ORDER ZERO COEFFICIENTS.
         BY DEFINITION DISTRIBUTIONS DEFINED BY LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS
         ARE NORMALIZED TO UNITY.

     (3) ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS GIVEN BY A TABULATION (LTT=2)
     -------------------------------------------------------
     TABULATED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE GIVEN AT A SERIES OF ENERGIES.
     AN INTERPOLATION LAW IS GIVEN BETWEEN ENERGIES. THE INTERPOLATION
     LAW BETWEEN ENERGIES IS COPIED AS INPUT (I.E., NO ATTEMPT IS
     MADE TO LINEARIZE THE VARIATION WITH ENERGY). FOR EACH ENERGY AT
     AT WHICH TABULATED DATA ARE GIVEN A LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE ANGULAR
     DISITRIBUTION IS CONSTRUCTED IN THE SYSTEM IN WHICH THE TABULATED
     DATA ARE GIVEN (I.E., CM OR LAB - NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO CONVERT
     FROM ONE SYSTEM TO THE OTHER). A MAXIMUM OF 20000 POINTS IS ALLOWE
     TO REPRESENT THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION AT EACH ENERGY.

     ELIMINATION OF NEGATIVE VALUES
     ------------------------------
     THE RECONSTRUCTED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION WILL BE TESTED AND IF IT
     IS NEGATIVE AT ONE OR MORE COSINES AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE OUTPUT
     AND BASED ON THE INPUT OPTION SELECTED ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN (SEE, INPUT OPTIONS),
     (1) NO CORRECTION
     (2) CHANGE ALL TABULATED VALUES TO FORCE DISTRIBUTION TO BE
         POSITIVE (MINIMUM MORE THAN 1 MILLI-BARN). THE MINIMUM VALUE
         MAY BE CHANGED BY INPUT. WITH THIS OPTION THERE IS NO
         RESTRICTION ON THE AMOUNT THAT EACH VALUE IS CHANGED AND AS
         SUCH THIS OPTION SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION AND ONLY AS A
         LAST RESORT IF NO OTHER APPROACH CAN BE USED TO MAKE THE
         DISTRIBUTION POSITIVE.

     OUTPUT
     ------
     THE OUTPUT WILL BE THE LINEARIZED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION. THE
     TABULATED DISTRIBUTION WILL BE NORMALIZED TO UNITY BEFORE OUTPUT.

     CORRECTING NEGATIVE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION
     ----------------------------------------
     IF AN ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION IS NEGATIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE
     PRINTED AND THE USER MAY DECIDE (BASED ON INPUT OPTION) TO,
     (1) NOT PERFORM ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION.
     (2) FOR TABULATED DISTRIBUTIONS - ADD THE SAME VALUE TO EACH POINT
         VALUE SUCH THAT WHEN THE DISTRIBUTION IS RE-NORMALIZED THE
         MINIMUM VALUE IS 0.001 (1 MILLI-BARN). THE MINIMUM VALUE CAN
         BE CHANGED BY INPUT. WARNING...EXCEPT FOR SELECTION OF THE
         MINIMUM VALUE (BY INPUT) THE USER HAS NO CONTROL OVER HOW
         MUCH THE DISTRIBUTION IS CHANGED. THEREFORE THIS OPTION SHOULD
         BE USED WITH CAUTION.
     (3) FOR LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS ONE OF TWO OPTIONS MAY BE SELECTED,
     (A) CHANGE INDIVIDUAL COEFFICIENTS (NO ONE COEFFICIENT BY MORE
         THAN 1 PER-CENT) TO MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION POSITIVE WITH A
         MINIMUM VALUE OF 0.001 (1 MILLI-BARN). THE MAXIMUM PER-CENT
         CHANGE IN EACH COEFFICIENT AND MINIMUM VALUE MAY BE CHANGED
         BY INPUT. INPUT THE PROGRAM CANNOT MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION
         POSITIVE BY CHANGING EACH COEFFICIENT BY UP TO THE MAXIMUM
         ALLOWABLE AMOUNT, THE ORIGINAL ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION OR
         COEFFICIENTS WILL BE OUTPUT. ONLY IN THE LATTER CASE SHOULD
         ONE CONSIDER USING OPTION (B) DESCRIBED BELOW.
     (B) LOGICALLY ADD THE SAME VALUE TO EACH POINT VALUE SUCH THAT
         WHEN THE DISTRIBUTION IS RE-NORMALIZED THE MINIMUM VALUE IS
         0.001 (1 MILLI-BARN). THIS IS EQUIVALENT AT INCREASING P0
         BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND RE-NORMALIZATION IS EQUIVALENT TO THEN
         DIVIDING EACH COEFFICIENT BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT. THEREFORE,
         WHAT IS PHYSICALLY DONE BY THE PROGRAM IS TO DIVIDE EACH
         COEFFICIENT BY THE SAME AMOUNT. WARNING..EXCEPT FOR SELECTION
         OF THE MINIMUM VALUE (BY INPUT) THE USER HAS NO CONTROL OVER
         HOW MUCH THE DISTRIBUTION IS CHANGED. THEREFORE THIS OPTION
         SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.

     WARNING MESSAGES FROM PROGRAM
     -----------------------------
     THE WARNING MESSAGES PRINTED BY THIS PROGRAM SHOULD ONLY BE
     CONSIDERED TO BE EXACTLY THAT..WARNINGS..NOT AN ABSOLUTE JUDGEMENT
     BY THIS PROGRAM THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DATA. WHEN
     WARNING MESSAGES ARE PRINTED EXAMINE THE DATA AND EITHER TAKE NO
     ACTION (IF YOU FEEL THAT THE DATA IS O.K.) OR CORRECT THE DATA
     (IF YOU FEEL THAT THE DATA IS INCORRECT AND YOU CAN CORRECT IT).

     VALIDITY OF MODIFIED DATA
     -------------------------
     BEFORE BELIEVING AND USING DATA WHICH HAS BEEN MODIFIED (EITHER
     TABULATED ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS OR LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS) THE USER
     SHOULD INSURE THAT THE MODIFIED DATA IS PHYSICALLY MORE ACCEPTABLE
     THAN THE ORIGINAL DATA. IN ORDER TO DO THIS ONE OR MORE OF THE
     FOLLOWING METHODS SHOULD BE USED,

     (1) USE THE ENERGY VARIATION TESTS BUILT-IN TO THIS PROGRAM AND
         EVALPLOT TO PLOT THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE LEGENDRE
         COEFFICIENTS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT (BY HAND...NOT
         BY THIS PROGRAM) ANY COEFFICIENTS WHICH HAVE UNREALISTIC
         ENERGY AND L ORDER VARIATIONS. THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE DONE
         FIRST TO ELIMINATE MAJOR PROBLEMS BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM
         TO AUTOMATICALLY MAKE MINOR CORRECTIONS.
     (1) OUTPUT AND PLOT THE UNCORRECTED AND CORRECTED ANGULAR
         DISTRIBUTIONS. COMPARE THE PLOTS TO INSURE THAT THE CORRECTED
         DATA DOES NOT SERIOUSLY CHANGE THE ENERGY DEPENDENCE OF THE
         ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION.
     (2) IF PLOTTING CAPABILITY IS NOT AVAIALABLE, USE THE PRINTED OUT
         OF THIS PROGRAM TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH THE TABULATED ANGULAR
         DISTRIBUTION OR LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED.
         GENERALLY IF ONE COEFFICIENT HAS BEEN ONLY SLIGHTLY MODIFIED
         THE DISTRIBUTION WILL BE ACCEPTABLE. HOWEVER IF MANY
         COEFFICIENTS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED THE RESULT WILL NOT BE
         RELIABLE.

     SEEING ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS AND LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS
     ------------------------------------------------------
     PROGRAM EVALPLOT CAN BE USED TO PLOT ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION AND
     LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS - WHEN IT COMES TO CHECKING THIS TYPE OF
     DATA THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PLOTS OF THE DATA TO MAKE THE
     JOB EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD.

     FOR LEGENDRE COEFFICIENTS EVALPLOT CAN BE USED TO SEE THE ENERGY
     DEPENDENCE OF EACH COEFFICIENT - THIS IS AN EXTREMELY EASY AND
     USEFUL WAY TO CHECK FOR ERRORS IN THE BASIC DATA.

     FOR ANGULAR DISTRIBUTION EVALPLOT CAN BE USED TO PLOT THEM AT
     EACH ENERGY THAT THEY ARE TABULATED - THIS IS ALSO AN EASY AND
     USEFUL WAY TO CHECK FOR ERRORS.
