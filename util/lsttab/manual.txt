  Manual for Program LSTTAB
  =========================

  The program uses the list file generated by PLOTC4 to extract
  data from an ENDF file and from the C4 file containing EXFOR
  data in computational format (generated by X4TOX4) and writes
  them in PLOTTAB "curves" and "points" format, respectively.

  Instructions:
  Input parameters can be entered interactively in response to
  the prompts on the screen:
  - PLOTC4 list file.
  - ENDF source file.
  - EXFOR source file in computational format.
  - Index number from the PLOTC4 list file to be processed.
    NOTE: Several entries may be chosen, terminated by blank.

  Files used:
   Name Unit   Description
   FLLS LLS=1  PLOTC4 list file.
   FLEF LEF=2  ENDF source file.
   FLC4 LC4=3  EXFOR source file in computational format.
   FLPN LPN=7  Selected experimental points (PLOTTAB points fmt).
   FLCU LCU=8  Selected curve from ENDF file (PLOTTAB points fmt).
