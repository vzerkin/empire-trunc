C     PURPOSE
C     =======
C     THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO READ EVALUATED DATA IN THE ENDF/B
C     FORMAT, PERFORM CORRECTIONS AND OUTPUT THE RESULT IN THE ENDF/B
C     FORMAT. TWO TYPES OF CORRECTIONS ARE POSSIBLE (1) AUTOMATIC AND
C     (2) OPTIONAL (BASED ON USER INPUT) CORRECTIONS.
C
C     ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO
C     RE-DEFINE ALL REDUNDANT CROSS SECTIONS (E.G. TOTAL) TO BE EXACTLY
C     EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. THIS PROCEDURE ELIMINATES THE
C     PROBLEM WITH MANY ENDF/B EVALUATIONS, WHERE DUE TO THE USE OF
C     NON-LINEAR INTERPOLATION LAWS THE TOTAL MAY BE EQUAL TO THE SUM
C     OF ITS PARTS AT ALL TABULATED ENERGIES, BUT BASED ON THE
C     INTERPOLATION LAWS IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFERENT AT ENERGIES BETWEEN
C     TABULATED ENERGIES.
C
C     AUTOMATIC CHECKS/CORRECTIONS
C     ============================
C     (1) CHECK THAT MAT/MF/MT DOES NOT CHANGE UNLESS A MEND/FEND/SEND
C         LINE IS READ. IF MAT/MF/MT CHANGES A WARNING MESSAGE IS
C         PRINTED BUT NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TAKEN.
C     (2) ALL LINES WITHIN A GIVEN MAT WILL BE SEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED
C         ON OUTPUT.
C
C     OPTIONAL CHECKS/CORRECTIONS
C     ===========================
C     THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS CORRESPOND TO THE INPUT DATA OPTION COLUMNS
C     (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE INPUT BELOW)
C
C     (1) CORRECT ZA AND AWR IN ALL SECTIONS. CHECK TO INSURE THAT THE
C         C1 AND C2 VALUES (ZA AND AWR) ARE THE SAME IN ALL SECTIONS.
C         THE C1 AND C2 OF THE FIRST SECTION READ ARE ASSUMED TO BE
C         CORRECT AND ARE USED FOR COMPARISON. IF THE C1 AND/OR C2 OF
C         THE FIRST SECTION ARE NOT POSITIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE IS OUTPUT
C         AND THE MATERIAL IS COPIED WITHOUT CHANGE.
C         NOTE....TO CHANGE THE ZA AND/OR AWR OF ANY MATERIAL IT IS
C         MERELY NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE ZA AND/OR AWR IN THE FIRST
C         SECTION OF THE MATERIAL AND USE THIS OPTION TO AUTOMATICALLY
C         CHANGE ALL OTHER SECTIONS.
C     (2) CORRECT CROSS SECTION (MF=3) THRESHOLDS. THE Q-VALUE AND AWR
C         ARE USED TO DERIVE THE REACTION THRESHOLD USING THE RELATION,
C
C         E-THRESHOLD = -(Q-VALUE)*(AWRE+1.0)/AWRE
C
C         IF THE THRESHOLD IS POSITIVE THE CROSS SECTION IS CHECKED TO
C         INSURE THAT THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS AT THE THRESHOLD AND
C         HAS A ZERO CROSS SECTION. IF NOT, THE CROSS SECTION WILL BE
C         CHANGED.
C         (A) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD AND
C             HAS A ZERO CROSS SECTION, THE POINT IS DELETED AND A POINT
C             IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
C         (B) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD AND
C             HAS A NON-ZERO CROSS SECTION, A POINT WITH ZERO CROSS
C             SECTION IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
C         (C) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD AND
C             HAS A NON-ZERO CROSS SECTION, ALL POINTS BELOW THE
C             THRESHOLD ARE DELETED AND A POINT WITH ZERO CROSS SECTION
C             IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
C     (3) EXTEND ALL CROSS SECTIONS (MF=3) TO 20 MEV. IF THE TABULATED
C         CROSS SECTION ENDS BELOW 20 MEV IT WILL BE EXTENDED TO 20 MEV
C         AS EITHER ZERO (IMOPS(3)=1) OR CONSTANT (IMOPS(3)=2) EQUAL
C         TO THE LAST TABULATED VALUE.
C     (4) ALLOW REACTION (MF=3, ANY MT) DELETION. ALL SPECIFIED
C         REACTIONS WILL BE DELETED WHEN THE DATA IS READ FROM THE
C         INPUT ENDF/B DATA FILE AND WILL NOT BE IN THE OUTPUT ENDF/B
C         DATA FILE. WARNING DELETED REACTIONS MAY NOT BE USED TO DEFINE
C         ANY RECONSTRUCTED REACTIONS (I.E. REACTIONS DEFINED BY SUMMING
C         OTHER REACTIONS). SINCE DELETED REACTIONS ARE DELETED DURING
C         READING IT IS AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED AND IF ANY DELETED
C         REACTION IS REQUIRED LATER TO DEFINE ANY SUM AN ERROR WILL
C         RESULT. THE USER MAY SPECIFY THAT THE DELETION RULES ARE TO BE
C         READ FROM INPUT (IMOPS(4)=1) OR THAT THE BUILT IN SUMMATION
C         RULES ARE TO BE USED (MOPS(4)=2). AT THE PRESENT TIME THE
C         BUILT-IN DELETION RULES ARE THAT NO SECTIONS SHOULD BE DELETED
C         (THE USER MAY OVERRIDE THIS CONVENTION BY INPUT).
C     (5) ALLOW REACTION (MF=3, ANY MT) RECONSTRUCTION BY SUMMING OTHER
C         REACTIONS. IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE RUNNING TIME OF THIS
C         PROGRAM CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF
C         TIMES THAT EACH CONTRIBUTING CROSS SECTION MUST BE USED.
C         THE USED MAY SPECIFY THAT THE SUMMATION RULES ARE TO BE READ
C         AS INPUT (IMOPS(5)=1) OR THAT THE BUILT IN SUMMATION RULES
C         ARE TO BE USED (IMOPS(5)=2). THE BUILT IN SUMMATION RULES ARE
C         DESIGNED TO USE ENDF/B CONVENTIONS AND TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER
C         OF TIMES THAT EACH CROSS SECTION IS USED.
C     (6) INSURE THAT ALL CROSS SECTIONS ARE NON-NEGATIVE (I.E. ARE
C         ZERO OR POSITIVE). DURING READING ALL NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS
C         WILL BE SET EQUAL TO ZERO AND TREATED AS SUCH DURING ALL
C         SUBSEQUENT SUMMATIONS AND ENDF/B OUTPUT.
C         NOTE...THIS OPTION SHOULD NEVER BE USED WITH DATA CONTAINING
C         BACKGROUND CROSS SECTIONS WHICH MAY BE NEGATIVE. ONLY AFTER
C         THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BACKGROUND
C         TO DEFINE THE ACTUAL CROSS SECTION IS IT VALID TO ELIMINATE
C         NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS.
C         NOTE...THIS OPTION MAY BE USED TO DELETE NEGATIVE ELASTIC
C         CROSS SECTIONS THAT MAY RESULT FROM RECONSTRUCTING CROSS
C         SECTIONS FROM SINGLE LEVEL BREIT-WIGNER PARAMETERS. IF THE
C         TOTAL CROSS SECTION IS THEN RECONSTRUCTED USING THE CORRECTED
C         ELASTIC CROSS SECTION THE TOTAL WILL BE POSITIVE DUE TO THE
C         CONTRIBUTIONS OF CAPTURE AND FISSION (THUS AVOIDING NUMERICAL
C         INSTABILITY PROBLEMS DURING SELF-SHIELDING CALCULATIONS).
C     (7) WITHIN EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS DELETE ENERGIES THAT
C         ARE NOT IN ASCENDING ENERGY ORDER (ENERGY REPETITION IS O.K.)
C     (8) WITHIN EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS ELIMINATE DUPLICATE
C         POINTS (SUCCESSIVE POINTS WITH THE SAME ENERGY-CROSS SECTION).
C     (9) TEST THAT ALL SECTIONS ARE IN ASCENDING MAT/MF/MT ORDER.
C         IF NOT, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN, ONLY AN ERROR
C         MESSAGE WILL BE OUTPUT.
C    (10) CHECK MF/MT FOR EACH SECTION TO INSURE THAT THEY ARE DEFINED
C         IN THE ENDF/B FORMAR MANUAL. IF THEY ARE NOT DEFINED AN ERROR
C         MESSAGE IS PRINTED, BUT NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TAKEN.
C    (11) ALLOW SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL (INPUT)
C         EVALUATION TO BE CREATED. NORMALLY THIS PROGRAM WILL ONLY
C         RECONSTRUCT AND OUTPUT SECTIONS IF THE SECTION IS PRESENT
C         IN THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION. THIS PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED BECAUSE
C         NORMALLY THE PROGRAM DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DEFINE THE CONTENTS
C         OF THE FIRST TWO LINES OF THE SECTION (E.G., Q-VALUE,
C         TEMPERATURE, INITIAL AND FINAL STATES). THIS OPTION MAY BE
C         USED TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO READ AND SAVE A TABLE DEFINING
C         THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST TWO LINES OF EACH SECTION TO BE
C         CREATED.
C         NOTE...IF A SECTION IS PRESENT ANY COMMAND TO CREATE IT WILL
C         BE IGNORED.
C     (12)ALLOW ENERGY POINTS TO BE INSERTED. THE PROGRAM CAN READ UP
C         TO 50, ENERGIES, MAT, MT AND USE LINEAR INTERPOLATION TO
C         INSERT ENERGY POINTS INTO TABLES AS THEY ARE READ, E.G.,
C         INSERT AN ENERGY POINT AT THERMAL ENERGY (0.0253 EV). IF
C         AN MAT AND/OR MT IS ZERO THIS IMPLIES = ALL - INSERT THE
C         ENERGY IN ALL TABLES.
C     (13)PUT ALLOW CROSS SECTIONS ON A UNIFORM ENERGY GRID = EACH
C         SECTION (MT) OF CROSS SECTIONS WILL INCLUDE ALL ENERGIES
C         WHICH APPEAR IN AT LEAST ONE SECTION OF DATA. PARAMETERS
C         (MT=251 THROUGH 255) ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE UNIFORM ENERGY
C         GRID.
C     (14)DELETE SECTION IF CROSS SECTION = 0 AT ALL ENERGIES. THIS
C         SOUNDS LIKE AN ABSURD OPTION, BUT IS REQUIRED BECAUSE SUCH
C         SECTIONS EXIST IN ENDF/B-VI.
C
C     CREATING RATIOS AND PRODUCTS
C     ============================
C     IN ORDER TO CREATE RATIOS AND PRODUCTS = NEW MT NUMBERS, YOU MUST
C     DO TWO THINGS,
C
C     1) DEFINE EACH NEW MT NUMBER AS A RATIO OR PRODUCT OF TWO MT
C        NUMBERS.
C
C     2) USE THE CREATE MT NUMBER OPTION AND INPUT THE FIRST TWO LINES
C        OF THE SECTION
C
C     WARNING - UNLESS YOU DO BOTH OF THESE YOU WILL NOT OBTAIN OUTPUT
C     IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT.
C
C     TWO SPECIAL MT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY CSEWG INVOLVING
C     RATIOS AND PRODUCTS,
C
C     ALPHA (MT=254)= CAPTURE (MT=102)/FISSION (MT=18)
C
C     ETA (MT=255)  = NU-BAR (MT=452)*FISSION (MT=18)/ABSORPTION (MT=27)
C
C     ABSORPTION (MT=27) = FISSION (MT=18) + SUM (MT=102 THROUGH 116)
C
C     AS YET THERE IS NO STANDARD DEFINITION OF MT NUMBERS FOR RATIO
C     OR PRODUCT DATA. YOU ARE FREE TO USE ANY MT NUMBERS NORMALLY NOT
C     USED IN THE ENDF/B. HOWEVER, IT WILL THEN BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
C     TO PROPERLY INTERPRET THE RESULTS, I.E., NOBODY ELSE WILL HAVE
C     ANY IDEA HOW TO INTERPRET A TABLE OF DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE MT
C     NUMBERS YOU HAVE USED.
C
C     THIS PROGRAM CAN BE ONLY DIRECTLY DEFINE RATIOS AND PRODUCTS
C     USING TWO MT NUMBERS = BINARY OPERATIONS, E.G., DEFINE THE CAPTURE
C     TO FISSION RATIO, OR DEFINE THE PRODUCT NU-BAR*FISSION.
C
C     THIS PROGRAM CANNOT DIRECTLY DEFINE RATIO OR PRODUCT OF A SUM OF
C     SECTIONS TO THE SUM OF ANOTHER SET OF SECTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS CAN
C     BE DONE INDIRECTLY BY FIRST DEFINING A DUMMY MT NUMBER (ANY MT
C     NUMBER NOT NORMALLY USED IN ENDF/B) TO BE A SUM OF SECTIONS AND
C     A SECOND DUMMY MT NUMBER TO BE A SECOND SUM OF SECTIONS. YOU CAN
C     THEN DEFINE RATIO OR PRODUCT YOU REQUIRE TO BE THE RATIO OF THESE
C     TWO DUMMY MT NUMBERS.
C
C     FOR EXAMPLE, TO DEFINE ETA,
C     1) FIRST DEFINE (MT=27) = (MT=27) + (SUM OF MT=102 THROUGH 116)
C     2) NEXT DEFINE (MT=333) = (MT=452)*(MT=18)
C     3) LAST DEFINE (MT=255) = (MT=333)/(MT=27)
C     DO NOT FORGET TO TURN ON THE CREATE SECTION OPTION (ON THE FIRST
C     INPUT LINE) AND INPUT THE FIRST TWO LINES OF SECTION MT=255 -
C     OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ENDF/B FORMATTED OUTPUT.
C
C     THE ONLY SPECIAL CONVENTIONS USED BY THIS PROGRAM IN CALCULATING
C     RATIOS ARE WHEN THE DENOMINATOR OF THE RATIO IS ZERO. IN THIS
C     CASE IF THE NUMERATOR IS ALSO ZERO THE RATIO IS DEFINED TO BE ONE.
C     IN THIS CASE IF THE NUMERATOR IS NOT ZERO THE RATIO IS DEFINED
C     TO BE ZERO.
C
C     ENDF/B FORMAT
C     =============
C     THIS PROGRAM MAY BE USED WITH DATA IN ANY VERSION OF THE ENDF/B
C     FORMAT (I.E. ENDF/B-I, II, III, IV, V OR VI FORMAT). SINCE A
C     PAGING SYSTEM IS USED STORE CROSS SECTION TABLES ON SCRATCH FILES
C     THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE SIZE OF TABLES (E.G. THE TOTAL CROSS
C     SECTION MAY BE REPRESENTED BY 200,000 TABULATED POINTS).
C
C     WARNING
C     =======
C     (1) FOR EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS (I.E. EACH MT, MF=3) IN
C         THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION (I.E. ENDF/B DATA READ) ONE SECTION
C         OF DATA WILL BE OUTPUT, UNLESS THE SECTION HAS BEEN DELETED.
C         THIS INCLUDES ANY SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE
C         ORIGINAL EVALUATION, BUT THE USER INDICATES (BY INPUT) SHOULD
C         BE CREATED.
C
C         THE PROGRAM WILL NOT OUTPUT ANY SECTION RECONSTRUCTED BY
C         SUMMATION UNLESS THE CORRESPONDING SECTION (MT NUMBER) IS
C         PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION OR USER INPUT INDICATES
C         SHOULD BE CREATED AND OUTPUT. THIS IS (A) BECAUSE THE
C         PROGRAM CANNOT DEFINE THE PARAMETERS TO APPEAR ON THE FIRST
C         TWO LINES OF THE SECTION, (B) TO AVOID OUTPUTTING TOO MUCH
C         DATA WHICH THE USER MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN.
C
C     (2) FOR ANY SECTIONS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE ORIGINAL DATA THE
C         USER MAY SPECIFY THAT THEY BE DEFINED BY SUMMATION. ANY SUCH
C         SECTION MAY BE USED BE DEFINE SUBSEQUENT SUMS, BUT THE SECTION
C         ITSELF WILL NOT BE OUTPUT (E.G. GENERALLY MT=27 AND 101 ARE
C         NOT PRESENT IN EVALUATIONS. HOWEVER, THE BUILT-IN SUMMATION
C         RULES OF THIS PROGRAM USES THE ENDF/B SUMMATION RULES TO
C         DEFINE MT=27 AND 101, WHICH IN TURN ARE USED TO DEFINE THE
C         NON-ELASTIC CROSS SECTION, MT=3. SECTIONS MT=27 AND 101 ARE
C         NOT OUTPUT).
C
C     (3) ALL DATA IN FILE 3 AND 23 MUST BE LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE. IF
C         THE DATA IS NOT LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE THIS PROGRAM WILL
C         TERMINATE.
C
C     PROGRAM OPERATION
C     =================
C     ALL MAT NUMBER ON AN ENDF/B TAPE ARE PROCESSED. EACH MAT IS
C     TREATED SEPARATELY. WITHIN EACH MAT, EACH SECTION BEFORE MF=3
C     IS READ, CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND OUTPUT.
C     WHEN MF=3 IS LOCATED ALL CROSS SECTIONS ARE READ, SECTIONS TO BE
C     DELETED ARE DELETED, SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENTED AND USER
C     INPUT INDICATES SHOULD BE CREATED ARE CREATE, SECTIONS TO BE KEPT
C     ARE CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND WRITTEN TO A
C     SCRATCH FILE. NEXT, IF THE USER SPECIFIES THAT THEY SHOULD,
C     SECTIONS ARE RECONSTRUCTED. FINALLY ALL CROSS SECTIONS (OLD AND
C     NEW) ARE OUTPUT. WITHIN THE SAME MAT, EACH SECTION AFTER MF=3 IS
C     READ, CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND OUTPUT.
C
C     MF=3
C     ====
C     THE TREATMENT OF THE CROSS SECTIONS REQUIRES UP TO 4 PASSES FOR
C     CROSS SECTIONS. IN THE PROGRAM THEY CORRESPOND TO SUBROUTINES
C     PASS1, PASS2, PASS3 AND PASS4. THE ORIGINAL AND FINAL ENDF/B DATA
C     FILES, 5 SCRATCH FILES AND 3 IN CORE ARRAYS ARE USED. OPERATIONS
C     PERFORMED DURING EACH PASS ARE,
C
C     PASS1
C     =====
C     READ ALL CROSS SECTIONS FROM ITAPE. DELETED ANY SECTIONS. CREATE
C     ANY SECTIONS. CHECK/CORRECT THEM AND WRITE THEM TO SCRATCH FILE.

C
C     THE UNIFORM ENERGY GRID ENDS UP ON ISCRB. NEXT EACH SECTION OF
C     CROSS SECTIONS FROM PASS1 IS READ FROM ISCRC, INTERPOLATED TO
C     THE UNIFORM ENERGY GRID AND OUTPUT TO ISCRA. FINALLY ISCRA AND
C     ISCRC ARE SWITCH, SO THAT AT THE END OF THIS PASS THE DATA WILL
C     AGAIN BE ON ISCRC (EXACTLY AS AT THE END OF PASS1), WITH UPDATED
C     POINT COUNTS.

C     =====
C     SUMMATION CROSS SECTIONS ARE DEFINED BY READING DATA FROM ISCRC
C     AND MERGING THEM ONTO ISCRA. THE FIRST SECTION THAT CONTRIBUTES
C     TO A SUM IS MERELY COPIED FROM C TO A. IF MORE SECTIONS WILL
C     CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUM THE DATA IN A IS TRANSFERRED TO B, A
C     SECTION OF DATA FROM C IS ADDED TO THE DATA IN B AND STORED IN
C     A. THE CYLE OF ADDED C AND B TO A, FOLLOWED BY MOVING A TO B
C     IS CONTINUED UNTIL ALL CONTRIBUTING SECTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED.
C     THE SUM IS THEN COPIED FROM A TO D. IF NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SECTION
C     IS REQUIRED FOR ANY LATER SUMMUATIONS IT IS ALSO COPIED TO E.
C     THE CYCLE OF ADDED SECTIONS FROM C AND B TO A IS REPEATED FOR
C     EACH REQUIRED SUMMATION REACTION. IN ADDITION TO SECTIONS FROM
C     C, AFTER THE FIRST SUMMATION SECTIONS MAY ALSO BE ADDED TO A
C     FROM E (THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW RECONSTRUCTED CROSS SECTIONS).

C     CAN THEN BE USED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOLLOWING SUM TO DEFINE

C     IS RECONSTRUCTED BEFORE MT=4, THE ORIGINAL MT=4 WILL BE USED IN
C     THE SUMMATION TO DEFINE MT=3. THE SAME RULES APPLY TO CALCULATING
C     RATIOS, IF EITHER THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR IS TO BE DEFINED
C     BY SUMMATION, THIS SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE DEFINING THE RATIO BY
C     INPUT PARAMETERS.

C     WARNING
C     =======
C     ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW REACTIONS TO BE DEFINED
C     BY ADDING OR SUBTRACTING REACTIONS THE USER SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO
C     DEFINE REACTIONS BY SUMMING TO AVOID NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS. FOR
C     EXAMPLE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MT=3 AND DEFINE MT=1 AS THE
C     SUM OF MT=2 AND 3 (THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH AS USED IN THE ABOVE
C     INPUT). ALTERATIVELY IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MT=1 AND DEFINE
C     MT=3 AS MT=1 MINUS MT=2 (THIS APPROACH IS NOT RECOMMENDED).
C
C     THE ONLY BUILT-IN SUMMATION RULE THAT USES SUBTRACTION IS THE
C     CALCULATION OF THE FIRST CHANGE FISSION (MT=19) AS THE TOTAL
C     FISSION (MT=18) MINUS THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH CHANGE FISSION
C     (MT=20, 21, 38). THIS HAS BEEN DONE TO ALLOW THE RESONANCE
C     CONTRIBUTION, CALCULATED BY MANY CODES AND INCLUDED IN MT=18,
C     TO BE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED IN THE FIRST CHANCE FISSION.
