     PURPOSE
     =======
     THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO READ EVALUATED DATA IN THE ENDF/B
     FORMAT, PERFORM CORRECTIONS AND OUTPUT THE RESULT IN THE ENDF/B
     FORMAT. TWO TYPES OF CORRECTIONS ARE POSSIBLE (1) AUTOMATIC AND
     (2) OPTIONAL (BASED ON USER INPUT) CORRECTIONS.

     ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO
     RE-DEFINE ALL REDUNDANT CROSS SECTIONS (E.G. TOTAL) TO BE EXACTLY
     EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. THIS PROCEDURE ELIMINATES THE
     PROBLEM WITH MANY ENDF/B EVALUATIONS, WHERE DUE TO THE USE OF
     NON-LINEAR INTERPOLATION LAWS THE TOTAL MAY BE EQUAL TO THE SUM
     OF ITS PARTS AT ALL TABULATED ENERGIES, BUT BASED ON THE
     INTERPOLATION LAWS IT CAN BE QUITE DIFFERENT AT ENERGIES BETWEEN
     TABULATED ENERGIES.

     AUTOMATIC CHECKS/CORRECTIONS
     ============================
     (1) CHECK THAT MAT/MF/MT DOES NOT CHANGE UNLESS A MEND/FEND/SEND
         LINE IS READ. IF MAT/MF/MT CHANGES A WARNING MESSAGE IS
         PRINTED BUT NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TAKEN.
     (2) ALL LINES WITHIN A GIVEN MAT WILL BE SEQUENTIALLY NUMBERED
         ON OUTPUT.

     OPTIONAL CHECKS/CORRECTIONS
     ===========================
     THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS CORRESPOND TO THE INPUT DATA OPTION COLUMNS
     (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE INPUT BELOW)

     (1) CORRECT ZA AND AWR IN ALL SECTIONS. CHECK TO INSURE THAT THE
         C1 AND C2 VALUES (ZA AND AWR) ARE THE SAME IN ALL SECTIONS.
         THE C1 AND C2 OF THE FIRST SECTION READ ARE ASSUMED TO BE
         CORRECT AND ARE USED FOR COMPARISON. IF THE C1 AND/OR C2 OF
         THE FIRST SECTION ARE NOT POSITIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE IS OUTPUT
         AND THE MATERIAL IS COPIED WITHOUT CHANGE.
         NOTE....TO CHANGE THE ZA AND/OR AWR OF ANY MATERIAL IT IS
         MERELY NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE ZA AND/OR AWR IN THE FIRST
         SECTION OF THE MATERIAL AND USE THIS OPTION TO AUTOMATICALLY
         CHANGE ALL OTHER SECTIONS.
     (2) CORRECT CROSS SECTION (MF=3) THRESHOLDS. THE Q-VALUE AND AWR
         ARE USED TO DERIVE THE REACTION THRESHOLD USING THE RELATION,

         E-THRESHOLD = -(Q-VALUE)*(AWRE+1.0)/AWRE

         IF THE THRESHOLD IS POSITIVE THE CROSS SECTION IS CHECKED TO
         INSURE THAT THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS AT THE THRESHOLD AND
         HAS A ZERO CROSS SECTION. IF NOT, THE CROSS SECTION WILL BE
         CHANGED.
         (A) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD AND
             HAS A ZERO CROSS SECTION, THE POINT IS DELETED AND A POINT
             IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
         (B) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD AND
             HAS A NON-ZERO CROSS SECTION, A POINT WITH ZERO CROSS
             SECTION IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
         (C) IF THE FIRST TABULATED POINT IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD AND
             HAS A NON-ZERO CROSS SECTION, ALL POINTS BELOW THE
             THRESHOLD ARE DELETED AND A POINT WITH ZERO CROSS SECTION
             IS INSERTED AT THE THRESHOLD.
     (3) EXTEND ALL CROSS SECTIONS (MF=3) TO 20 MEV. IF THE TABULATED
         CROSS SECTION ENDS BELOW 20 MEV IT WILL BE EXTENDED TO 20 MEV
         AS EITHER ZERO (IMOPS(3)=1) OR CONSTANT (IMOPS(3)=2) EQUAL
         TO THE LAST TABULATED VALUE.
     (4) ALLOW REACTION (MF=3, ANY MT) DELETION. ALL SPECIFIED
         REACTIONS WILL BE DELETED WHEN THE DATA IS READ FROM THE
         INPUT ENDF/B DATA FILE AND WILL NOT BE IN THE OUTPUT ENDF/B
         DATA FILE. WARNING DELETED REACTIONS MAY NOT BE USED TO DEFINE
         ANY RECONSTRUCTED REACTIONS (I.E. REACTIONS DEFINED BY SUMMING
         OTHER REACTIONS). SINCE DELETED REACTIONS ARE DELETED DURING
         READING IT IS AS IF THEY NEVER EXISTED AND IF ANY DELETED
         REACTION IS REQUIRED LATER TO DEFINE ANY SUM AN ERROR WILL
         RESULT. THE USER MAY SPECIFY THAT THE DELETION RULES ARE TO BE
         READ FROM INPUT (IMOPS(4)=1) OR THAT THE BUILT IN SUMMATION
         RULES ARE TO BE USED (MOPS(4)=2). AT THE PRESENT TIME THE
         BUILT-IN DELETION RULES ARE THAT NO SECTIONS SHOULD BE DELETED
         (THE USER MAY OVERRIDE THIS CONVENTION BY INPUT).
     (5) ALLOW REACTION (MF=3, ANY MT) RECONSTRUCTION BY SUMMING OTHER
         REACTIONS. IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE RUNNING TIME OF THIS
         PROGRAM CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF
         TIMES THAT EACH CONTRIBUTING CROSS SECTION MUST BE USED.
         THE USED MAY SPECIFY THAT THE SUMMATION RULES ARE TO BE READ
         AS INPUT (IMOPS(5)=1) OR THAT THE BUILT IN SUMMATION RULES
         ARE TO BE USED (IMOPS(5)=2). THE BUILT IN SUMMATION RULES ARE
         DESIGNED TO USE ENDF/B CONVENTIONS AND TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER
         OF TIMES THAT EACH CROSS SECTION IS USED.
     (6) INSURE THAT ALL CROSS SECTIONS ARE NON-NEGATIVE (I.E. ARE
         ZERO OR POSITIVE). DURING READING ALL NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS
         WILL BE SET EQUAL TO ZERO AND TREATED AS SUCH DURING ALL
         SUBSEQUENT SUMMATIONS AND ENDF/B OUTPUT.
         NOTE...THIS OPTION SHOULD NEVER BE USED WITH DATA CONTAINING
         BACKGROUND CROSS SECTIONS WHICH MAY BE NEGATIVE. ONLY AFTER
         THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BACKGROUND
         TO DEFINE THE ACTUAL CROSS SECTION IS IT VALID TO ELIMINATE
         NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS.
         NOTE...THIS OPTION MAY BE USED TO DELETE NEGATIVE ELASTIC
         CROSS SECTIONS THAT MAY RESULT FROM RECONSTRUCTING CROSS
         SECTIONS FROM SINGLE LEVEL BREIT-WIGNER PARAMETERS. IF THE
         TOTAL CROSS SECTION IS THEN RECONSTRUCTED USING THE CORRECTED
         ELASTIC CROSS SECTION THE TOTAL WILL BE POSITIVE DUE TO THE
         CONTRIBUTIONS OF CAPTURE AND FISSION (THUS AVOIDING NUMERICAL
         INSTABILITY PROBLEMS DURING SELF-SHIELDING CALCULATIONS).
     (7) WITHIN EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS DELETE ENERGIES THAT
         ARE NOT IN ASCENDING ENERGY ORDER (ENERGY REPETITION IS O.K.)
     (8) WITHIN EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS ELIMINATE DUPLICATE
         POINTS (SUCCESSIVE POINTS WITH THE SAME ENERGY-CROSS SECTION).
     (9) TEST THAT ALL SECTIONS ARE IN ASCENDING MAT/MF/MT ORDER.
         IF NOT, NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WILL BE TAKEN, ONLY AN ERROR
         MESSAGE WILL BE OUTPUT.
    (10) CHECK MF/MT FOR EACH SECTION TO INSURE THAT THEY ARE DEFINED
         IN THE ENDF/B FORMAR MANUAL. IF THEY ARE NOT DEFINED AN ERROR
         MESSAGE IS PRINTED, BUT NO CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TAKEN.
    (11) ALLOW SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL (INPUT)
         EVALUATION TO BE CREATED. NORMALLY THIS PROGRAM WILL ONLY
         RECONSTRUCT AND OUTPUT SECTIONS IF THE SECTION IS PRESENT
         IN THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION. THIS PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED BECAUSE
         NORMALLY THE PROGRAM DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO DEFINE THE CONTENTS
         OF THE FIRST TWO LINES OF THE SECTION (E.G., Q-VALUE,
         TEMPERATURE, INITIAL AND FINAL STATES). THIS OPTION MAY BE
         USED TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO READ AND SAVE A TABLE DEFINING
         THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST TWO LINES OF EACH SECTION TO BE
         CREATED.
         NOTE...IF A SECTION IS PRESENT ANY COMMAND TO CREATE IT WILL
         BE IGNORED.
     (12)ALLOW ENERGY POINTS TO BE INSERTED. THE PROGRAM CAN READ UP
         TO 50, ENERGIES, MAT, MT AND USE LINEAR INTERPOLATION TO
         INSERT ENERGY POINTS INTO TABLES AS THEY ARE READ, E.G.,
         INSERT AN ENERGY POINT AT THERMAL ENERGY (0.0253 EV). IF
         AN MAT AND/OR MT IS ZERO THIS IMPLIES = ALL - INSERT THE
         ENERGY IN ALL TABLES.
     (13)PUT ALLOW CROSS SECTIONS ON A UNIFORM ENERGY GRID = EACH
         SECTION (MT) OF CROSS SECTIONS WILL INCLUDE ALL ENERGIES
         WHICH APPEAR IN AT LEAST ONE SECTION OF DATA. PARAMETERS
         (MT=251 THROUGH 255) ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE UNIFORM ENERGY
         GRID.
     (14)DELETE SECTION IF CROSS SECTION = 0 AT ALL ENERGIES. THIS
         SOUNDS LIKE AN ABSURD OPTION, BUT IS REQUIRED BECAUSE SUCH
         SECTIONS EXIST IN ENDF/B-VI.

     CREATING RATIOS AND PRODUCTS
     ============================
     IN ORDER TO CREATE RATIOS AND PRODUCTS = NEW MT NUMBERS, YOU MUST
     DO TWO THINGS,

     1) DEFINE EACH NEW MT NUMBER AS A RATIO OR PRODUCT OF TWO MT
        NUMBERS.

     2) USE THE CREATE MT NUMBER OPTION AND INPUT THE FIRST TWO LINES
        OF THE SECTION

     WARNING - UNLESS YOU DO BOTH OF THESE YOU WILL NOT OBTAIN OUTPUT
     IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT.

     TWO SPECIAL MT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY CSEWG INVOLVING
     RATIOS AND PRODUCTS,

     ALPHA (MT=254)= CAPTURE (MT=102)/FISSION (MT=18)

     ETA (MT=255)  = NU-BAR (MT=452)*FISSION (MT=18)/ABSORPTION (MT=27)

     ABSORPTION (MT=27) = FISSION (MT=18) + SUM (MT=102 THROUGH 116)

     AS YET THERE IS NO STANDARD DEFINITION OF MT NUMBERS FOR RATIO
     OR PRODUCT DATA. YOU ARE FREE TO USE ANY MT NUMBERS NORMALLY NOT
     USED IN THE ENDF/B. HOWEVER, IT WILL THEN BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
     TO PROPERLY INTERPRET THE RESULTS, I.E., NOBODY ELSE WILL HAVE
     ANY IDEA HOW TO INTERPRET A TABLE OF DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE MT
     NUMBERS YOU HAVE USED.

     THIS PROGRAM CAN BE ONLY DIRECTLY DEFINE RATIOS AND PRODUCTS
     USING TWO MT NUMBERS = BINARY OPERATIONS, E.G., DEFINE THE CAPTURE
     TO FISSION RATIO, OR DEFINE THE PRODUCT NU-BAR*FISSION.

     THIS PROGRAM CANNOT DIRECTLY DEFINE RATIO OR PRODUCT OF A SUM OF
     SECTIONS TO THE SUM OF ANOTHER SET OF SECTIONS. HOWEVER, THIS CAN
     BE DONE INDIRECTLY BY FIRST DEFINING A DUMMY MT NUMBER (ANY MT
     NUMBER NOT NORMALLY USED IN ENDF/B) TO BE A SUM OF SECTIONS AND
     A SECOND DUMMY MT NUMBER TO BE A SECOND SUM OF SECTIONS. YOU CAN
     THEN DEFINE RATIO OR PRODUCT YOU REQUIRE TO BE THE RATIO OF THESE
     TWO DUMMY MT NUMBERS.

     FOR EXAMPLE, TO DEFINE ETA,
     1) FIRST DEFINE (MT=27) = (MT=27) + (SUM OF MT=102 THROUGH 116)
     2) NEXT DEFINE (MT=333) = (MT=452)*(MT=18)
     3) LAST DEFINE (MT=255) = (MT=333)/(MT=27)
     DO NOT FORGET TO TURN ON THE CREATE SECTION OPTION (ON THE FIRST
     INPUT LINE) AND INPUT THE FIRST TWO LINES OF SECTION MT=255 -
     OTHERWISE YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ENDF/B FORMATTED OUTPUT.

     THE ONLY SPECIAL CONVENTIONS USED BY THIS PROGRAM IN CALCULATING
     RATIOS ARE WHEN THE DENOMINATOR OF THE RATIO IS ZERO. IN THIS
     CASE IF THE NUMERATOR IS ALSO ZERO THE RATIO IS DEFINED TO BE ONE.
     IN THIS CASE IF THE NUMERATOR IS NOT ZERO THE RATIO IS DEFINED
     TO BE ZERO.

     ENDF/B FORMAT
     =============
     THIS PROGRAM MAY BE USED WITH DATA IN ANY VERSION OF THE ENDF/B
     FORMAT (I.E. ENDF/B-I, II, III, IV, V OR VI FORMAT). SINCE A
     PAGING SYSTEM IS USED STORE CROSS SECTION TABLES ON SCRATCH FILES
     THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE SIZE OF TABLES (E.G. THE TOTAL CROSS
     SECTION MAY BE REPRESENTED BY 200,000 TABULATED POINTS).

     WARNING
     =======
     (1) FOR EACH SECTION OF CROSS SECTIONS (I.E. EACH MT, MF=3) IN
         THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION (I.E. ENDF/B DATA READ) ONE SECTION
         OF DATA WILL BE OUTPUT, UNLESS THE SECTION HAS BEEN DELETED.
         THIS INCLUDES ANY SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENT IN THE
         ORIGINAL EVALUATION, BUT THE USER INDICATES (BY INPUT) SHOULD
         BE CREATED.

         THE PROGRAM WILL NOT OUTPUT ANY SECTION RECONSTRUCTED BY
         SUMMATION UNLESS THE CORRESPONDING SECTION (MT NUMBER) IS
         PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION OR USER INPUT INDICATES
         SHOULD BE CREATED AND OUTPUT. THIS IS (A) BECAUSE THE
         PROGRAM CANNOT DEFINE THE PARAMETERS TO APPEAR ON THE FIRST
         TWO LINES OF THE SECTION, (B) TO AVOID OUTPUTTING TOO MUCH
         DATA WHICH THE USER MAY NOT BE INTERESTED IN.

     (2) FOR ANY SECTIONS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE ORIGINAL DATA THE
         USER MAY SPECIFY THAT THEY BE DEFINED BY SUMMATION. ANY SUCH
         SECTION MAY BE USED BE DEFINE SUBSEQUENT SUMS, BUT THE SECTION
         ITSELF WILL NOT BE OUTPUT (E.G. GENERALLY MT=27 AND 101 ARE
         NOT PRESENT IN EVALUATIONS. HOWEVER, THE BUILT-IN SUMMATION
         RULES OF THIS PROGRAM USES THE ENDF/B SUMMATION RULES TO
         DEFINE MT=27 AND 101, WHICH IN TURN ARE USED TO DEFINE THE
         NON-ELASTIC CROSS SECTION, MT=3. SECTIONS MT=27 AND 101 ARE
         NOT OUTPUT).

     (3) ALL DATA IN FILE 3 AND 23 MUST BE LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE. IF
         THE DATA IS NOT LINEARLY INTERPOLABLE THIS PROGRAM WILL
         TERMINATE.

     PROGRAM OPERATION
     =================
     ALL MAT NUMBER ON AN ENDF/B TAPE ARE PROCESSED. EACH MAT IS
     TREATED SEPARATELY. WITHIN EACH MAT, EACH SECTION BEFORE MF=3
     IS READ, CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND OUTPUT.
     WHEN MF=3 IS LOCATED ALL CROSS SECTIONS ARE READ, SECTIONS TO BE
     DELETED ARE DELETED, SECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENTED AND USER
     INPUT INDICATES SHOULD BE CREATED ARE CREATE, SECTIONS TO BE KEPT
     ARE CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND WRITTEN TO A
     SCRATCH FILE. NEXT, IF THE USER SPECIFIES THAT THEY SHOULD,
     SECTIONS ARE RECONSTRUCTED. FINALLY ALL CROSS SECTIONS (OLD AND
     NEW) ARE OUTPUT. WITHIN THE SAME MAT, EACH SECTION AFTER MF=3 IS
     READ, CHECKED/CORRECTED (BASED ON INPUT OPTIONS) AND OUTPUT.

     MF=3
     ====
     THE TREATMENT OF THE CROSS SECTIONS REQUIRES UP TO 4 PASSES FOR
     CROSS SECTIONS. IN THE PROGRAM THEY CORRESPOND TO SUBROUTINES
     PASS1, PASS2, PASS3 AND PASS4. THE ORIGINAL AND FINAL ENDF/B DATA
     FILES, 5 SCRATCH FILES AND 3 IN CORE ARRAYS ARE USED. OPERATIONS
     PERFORMED DURING EACH PASS ARE,

     PASS1
     =====
     READ ALL CROSS SECTIONS FROM ITAPE. DELETED ANY SECTIONS. CREATE
     ANY SECTIONS. CHECK/CORRECT THEM AND WRITE THEM TO SCRATCH FILE.
     DATA IS READ INTO ARRAY A, TRANSFERRED TO ARRAY C (AFTER EDITING)
     AND OUTPUT TO ISCRC FROM ARRAY C.
     ITAPE  - UNIT ORIGINAL ENDF/B DATA IS READ FROM.
     ISCRC  - SCRATCH UNIT THAT EDITED DATA IS WRITTEN ON.
     TABA   - ARRAY INTO WHICH ORIGINAL DATA IS READ.
     TABC   - ARRAY INTO WHICH EDITED DATA IS TRANSFERRED TO AND
              FROM WHICH IT IS WRITTEN TO ISCRC.

     PASS2
     =====
     IF A UNIFORM ENERGY GRID IS REQUESTED IT IS CREATED DURING THIS
     PASS. FIRST ALL OF THE CROSS SECTIONS FROM PASS1 ARE READ AND A
     UNIFORM ENERGY GRID IS CREATED = ALL ENERGIES THAT ARE INCLUDED
     IN AT LEAST ONE SECTION (MT) OF CROSS SECTIONS.
     ISCRA  - SCRATCH UNIT CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     ISCRB  - SCRATCH UNIT CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     ISCRC  - SCRATCH UNIT THAT EDITED DATA IS READ FROM.
     TABA   - ARRAY CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     TABB   - ARRAY CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     TABC   - ARRAY CONTAINING EDITED DATA.

     THE UNIFORM ENERGY GRID ENDS UP ON ISCRB. NEXT EACH SECTION OF
     CROSS SECTIONS FROM PASS1 IS READ FROM ISCRC, INTERPOLATED TO
     THE UNIFORM ENERGY GRID AND OUTPUT TO ISCRA. FINALLY ISCRA AND
     ISCRC ARE SWITCH, SO THAT AT THE END OF THIS PASS THE DATA WILL
     AGAIN BE ON ISCRC (EXACTLY AS AT THE END OF PASS1), WITH UPDATED
     POINT COUNTS.
     ISCRA  - SCRATCH UNIT THAT UNIFORM ENERGY GRID DATA IS WRITTEN ON.
     ISCRB  - SCRATCH UNIT CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     ISCRC  - SCRATCH UNIT THAT EDITED DATA IS READ FROM.
     TABA   - ARRAY CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID DATA.
     TABB   - ARRAY CONTAINING UNIFORM ENERGY GRID.
     TABC   - ARRAY CONTAINING EDITED DATA.

     PASS3
     =====
     SUMMATION CROSS SECTIONS ARE DEFINED BY READING DATA FROM ISCRC
     AND MERGING THEM ONTO ISCRA. THE FIRST SECTION THAT CONTRIBUTES
     TO A SUM IS MERELY COPIED FROM C TO A. IF MORE SECTIONS WILL
     CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUM THE DATA IN A IS TRANSFERRED TO B, A
     SECTION OF DATA FROM C IS ADDED TO THE DATA IN B AND STORED IN
     A. THE CYLE OF ADDED C AND B TO A, FOLLOWED BY MOVING A TO B
     IS CONTINUED UNTIL ALL CONTRIBUTING SECTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDED.
     THE SUM IS THEN COPIED FROM A TO D. IF NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SECTION
     IS REQUIRED FOR ANY LATER SUMMUATIONS IT IS ALSO COPIED TO E.
     THE CYCLE OF ADDED SECTIONS FROM C AND B TO A IS REPEATED FOR
     EACH REQUIRED SUMMATION REACTION. IN ADDITION TO SECTIONS FROM
     C, AFTER THE FIRST SUMMATION SECTIONS MAY ALSO BE ADDED TO A
     FROM E (THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW RECONSTRUCTED CROSS SECTIONS).
     WHEN ALL REQUIRED SECTIONS HAVE BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE NEW
     SECTIONS WILL BE ON E AND THE ORIGINAL SECTIONS ON C.
     ISCRC  - SCRATCH FILE FROM WHICH ORIGINAL DATA IS READ.
     ISCRA  - SCRATCH FILE ONTO WHICH SUM FOR ONE SECTION IS WRITTEN.
     ISCRD  - SCRATCH FILE ONTO WHICH ALL SUM CROSS SECTIONS ARE
              WRITTEN.
     ISCRE  - SCRATCH FILE ONTO WHICH ALL SUM CROSS SECTIONS WHICH
              ARE REQUIRED FOR LATER SUMS ARE WRITTEN.
     ISCRB  - UTILITY SCRATCH FILE USED TO CREATE SUM CROSS SECTIONS.
     TABA   - ARRAY INTO WHICH SUMS ARE WRITTEN.
     TABB   - ARRAY INTO WHICH PARTIAL SUMS ARE WRITTEN.
     TABC   - ARRAY INTO WHICH ORIGINAL DATA IS READ.

     PASS4
     =====
     CROSS SECTIONS ARE READ FROM ISCRC (ORIGINAL) AND ISCRD (NEW)
     AND ARE WRITTEN IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT ON OTAPE. THE BEGINNING OF
     EACH SECTION OF ORIGINAL DATA IS READ FROM ISCRC (TO DEFINE
     SECTION HEADER INFORMATION). IF THIS MT HAS NOT BEEN RECOSTRUCTED
     ON ISCRD THE ORIGINAL SECTION IS OUTPUT. IF THE SECTION HAS BEEN
     RECONSTRUCTED THE ORIGINAL SECTION IS SKIPPED AND THE NEW SECTION
     IS OUTPUT.
     OTAPE  - OUTPUT DATA IN THE ENDF/B FORMAT.
     ISCRC  - SCRATCH FILE FROM WHICH ORIGINAL DATA IS READ.
     ISCRD  - SCRATCH FILE FROM WHICH NEW DATA IS READ.
     TABC   - ARRAY INTO WHICH CROSS SECTIONS ARE READ FROM SCRATCH
              AND WRITTEN TO OTAPE

     TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOLLOWING SUM TO DEFINE MT=3, WHICH IN TURN
     CAN THEN BE USED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FOLLOWING SUM TO DEFINE
     MT=1. IF THE ORDER OF THE INPUT LINES IS CHANGED SUCH THAT MT=3
     IS RECONSTRUCTED BEFORE MT=4, THE ORIGINAL MT=4 WILL BE USED IN
     THE SUMMATION TO DEFINE MT=3. THE SAME RULES APPLY TO CALCULATING
     RATIOS, IF EITHER THE NUMERATOR OR DENOMINATOR IS TO BE DEFINED
     BY SUMMATION, THIS SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE DEFINING THE RATIO BY
     INPUT PARAMETERS.

     WARNING
     =======
     ALTHOUGH THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW REACTIONS TO BE DEFINED
     BY ADDING OR SUBTRACTING REACTIONS THE USER SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO
     DEFINE REACTIONS BY SUMMING TO AVOID NEGATIVE CROSS SECTIONS. FOR
     EXAMPLE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MT=3 AND DEFINE MT=1 AS THE
     SUM OF MT=2 AND 3 (THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH AS USED IN THE ABOVE
     INPUT). ALTERATIVELY IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALCULATE MT=1 AND DEFINE
     MT=3 AS MT=1 MINUS MT=2 (THIS APPROACH IS NOT RECOMMENDED).

     THE ONLY BUILT-IN SUMMATION RULE THAT USES SUBTRACTION IS THE
     CALCULATION OF THE FIRST CHANGE FISSION (MT=19) AS THE TOTAL
     FISSION (MT=18) MINUS THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH CHANGE FISSION
     (MT=20, 21, 38). THIS HAS BEEN DONE TO ALLOW THE RESONANCE
     CONTRIBUTION, CALCULATED BY MANY CODES AND INCLUDED IN MT=18,
     TO BE CONSISTENTLY INCLUDED IN THE FIRST CHANCE FISSION.
