< C     (SEE, SUBROUTINE FLOAT9). BY TESTING BEFORE CONVERTING THIS       PLO01730
< C     PROGRAM CAN DETERMINE WHETHER ANY GIVEN FIELD IS BLANK (NO DATA   PLO01740
< C     GIVEN) AS OPPOSED TO ZERO. IT IS OFTEN IMPORTANT TO MAKE THIS     PLO01750
< C     DISTINCTION, PARTICULARLY FOR FIELDS 7 AND 8, E.G. THE DIFFERENCE PLO01760

< C     THE EXFOR TO COMPUTATION FORMAT CONVERSION PROGRAM X4TOC4 ALSO    PLO01780
< C     MAKES THIS DISTINCTION AND LEAVES UNDEFINED FIELDS BLANK (NOT     PLO01790
