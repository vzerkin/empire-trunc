    You may  update the EXFOR files yourself using the latest version     
    available from the IAEA at http://www-nds.iaea.org/x4toc4-master/.   The C4 
    formatted source files have names like C4-Dec-11-2012.zip.  Unzip it, in the 
    EXFOR/ subdirectory of your current empire installation and run the parseC4.py
	script by issuing the following commands:
    
	unzip C4-2014-05-31.zip
	python parseC4.py C4-2014-05-31.xc4
