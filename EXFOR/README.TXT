    You may  update the EXFOR files yourself using the latest version     
    available from the IAEA at http://www-nds.iaea.org/x4toc4-master/.   The C4 
    formatted source files have names like C4-Dec-11-2012.zip.  Unzip it, in the 
    EXFOR/ subdirectory of your current empire installation and run the parseC4.py script:

        python parseC4.py C4-Dec-11-2012.x4c
