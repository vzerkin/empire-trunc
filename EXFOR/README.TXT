    You may  update the EXFOR files yourself using the latest version     
    available from the IAEA at http://www-nds.iaea.org/x4toc4-master/?C=M;O=D.
    The C4 formatted source files have names like "C4-2014-01-17.xc4.zip".
    Unzip it, in the EXFOR/ subdirectory of your current empire installation
    and run the parseC4.py script by issuing the following commands:
    
	unzip C4-2014-01-17.xc4.zip
	python parseC4.py ./C4-2014-01-17.xc4
