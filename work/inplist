                              EMPIRE-II

			                   Optional input

Optional input consists of an  arbitrary number of records, entered in
any order  and closed with the  GO record, which indicates  the end of
the input. In the simplest case  (all defaults) only GO record must be
entered. Each record starts with an alphanumeric keyword NAME which is
followed  by   the  value  VAL   and  eventually  by   the  positional
parameters. The keyword indicates a physical quantity, such as binding
energy or level  density parameter or an option.   VAL takes numerical
value  of the  quantity or  option*).  The  positional  parameters are
typically  used to  specify to  which nucleus  the quantity  should be
applied (generally  if these are omitted  the value is  applied to all
nuclei). Each record must be in the format:

              FORMAT (A6,G10.5,4I5) NAME, VAL, I1, I2, I3, I4

The  GO  record may  be  followed by  an  unlimited  list of  incident
energies (one per record) terminated with a record containing negative
value.  Anything below this line will be ignored by the code.

*) Any  line starting  with !, #,  or *  is treated as  comment. There
might be an arbitrary number of comments line in any input.
