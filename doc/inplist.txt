                           Optional input

Optional input consists of an  arbitrary number of records, entered in
any order  and closed with the  GO record, which indicates  the end of
the input. In the simplest case  (all defaults) only GO record must be
entered. Each record starts with an alphanumeric keyword NAME which is
followed  by   the  value  VAL   and  eventually  by   the  positional
parameters. The keyword indicates a physical quantity, such as binding
energy or level  density parameter or an option.   VAL takes numerical
value  of the  quantity or  option*).  The  positional  parameters are
typically  used to  specify to  which nucleus  the quantity  should be
applied (generally  if these are omitted  the value is  applied to all
nuclei). Each record must be in the format:

              FORMAT (A6,G10.5,4I5) NAME, VAL, I1, I2, I3, I4

The  GO  record may  be  followed by  an  unlimited  list of  incident
energies (one per record) terminated with a record containing negative
value.  Anything below this line will be ignored by the code.

*) Any  line starting  with !, #,  or *  is treated as  comment. There
might be an arbitrary number of comments line in the optional(!) input.

           sections are also taken from ECIS06.  Otherwise, spherical
           OM results are used. In any case, transmission
           coefficients for all emissions are calculated with
           spherical OM
       = 2 as above but all transmission coefficients for the
           incident nucleon emission are calculated within Coupled

FITOMP  Controls fitting of optical model potential in the incident channel
        =0 No fit (default)
        =1 GUI assisted manual fitting; only total, elastic, capture and inelastic 
           scattering are calculated independently of what is specified in the input.
           If plots with 'List names' ompR1 and eventually ompR2 are set they
           will be updated and reproduced after each run.
        =2 Automatic fit. See default EMPIRE input (../scripts/skel.inp) for
           keywords to be placed in the input. 

           Examples are given below.
           FITRVV     0.     500    1    !fit real volume depth (+- 5 MeV)
           FITIVV     0.     100    1    !fit imaginary volume depth (+- 1 MeV)
           FITISV     0.     100    1    !fit imaginary surface depth (+- 1 MeV)
           FITRVR     0.      10    1    !fit real volume radius (+- 0.1 fm)
           FITIVR     0.      10    1    !fit imaginary volume radius (+- 0.1 fm)
           FITRVD     0.      10    1    !fit real volume diffuseness (+- 0.1 fm)
           FITISD     0.       5    1    !fit imaginary surface diffuseness (+- 0.05 fm)
           FITDEF     0.      10    2    !fit l=2 (quadrupol) deformation  (+- 0.1)
           FITGRD                        !autmatic incident energy grid in omp fit
           FITITR     6.08               !increase number of iterations (default 3.05)
           The first value is an absolute (not a percentage) displacement from the current 
           value of the parameter in the *-omp.dir file. The second is the absolute value 
           (times 100) that defines the range of parameter variation. The third parameter
           indicate the position of the parameter in the RIPL-2 format.

The dimensions which may require modifications in everyday use of the
code are listed below:

NDNUC    maximum number of nuclei involved in the calculation

NDEJC    number of ejectiles (must be 3 or 4)

NDEX     maximum number of energy bins in the continuum discretization

NDLW     maximum number of partial waves to be considered in calculations

NDTL     maximum number of partial waves in SCAT2 (can be less than NDLW
         and must not be larger than 100 )

NDMSCS   number of steps in Multistep Compound

NDLV     maximum number of discrete levels in a single nucleus

NDBR     maximum number of branching ratios for each level
