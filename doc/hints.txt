                     Frequently Asked Questions 
 

Q I CHANGE OMP IN THE *-*.omp FILE BUT THERE IS NO EFFECT?

A When modifying omp in one of  the *.omp files be aware that the 
  potential appears for the incoming and the outgoing channel. If 
  projectile is the same as one of the ejectiles the same potential
  appears twice. To be on the safe side change BOTH.   


Q WHY USING 'Create ZVV' I GET NONSENSE?

A When using 'Create ZVV' procedure avoid specifying long strings with
  multiple blanks  inside. These will  be converted to a  single blank
  and the string  won't be matched properly. As  a consequence, ZVView
  will produce rubbish.


Q HOW CAN I ADD/CHANGE EXPERIMENTAL POINTS TO THE PLOTS?

A Editing  *.c4 file  is a  convenient  method of  removing or  adding
  experimental points  to the  plots.  See Help  -> X4TOC4  manual for
  description of the computational format (*.c4 file).


Q I'VE MADE 'CLEAN' AND LOST ALL FILES I HAD ADJUSTED BY HAND!

A Note that 'Clean' button will remove  ALL(!)  project related  files
  except the input.  If you  want to preserve any file (usually *.lev,
  *.omp or *.col  which could have been modified  manually) you should
  rename    them   before    making   'clean'    and    restore   them
  afterwords. Adding any  suffix will NOT work, adding a prefix will do
  the job.
  

Q I HAVE INTERUPTED EXECUTION WITH CTRL+C AND THE NEXT RUN CRASHES!

A When the running  code is interrupted or crashes  for any reason the
  next run may fail in spite of executing 'Clean' before. It is due to
  the  files that are  left from  the first  unsuccessful run  and not
  affected  by  'Clean'.   In  such  a case  make  'Clean'  again  and
  rerun. The third  trail should go through. If this is  not a case it
  is something to worry about.


Q WHY THERE ARE NO PLOTS PRODUCED?

A If no plots are produced there are several possibilities:
  a) ENDF  option set to 0 or  not activated (check input  file) 
  b) no experimental  data available (check  *.c4 or  *.exf file)  
  c) single incident energy requested 
  d) calculations were completed but one of the utility codes crashed  
     (check EMPEND, FIXUP, and SIXTAB outputs)
  e) EMPIRE exited  gracefully  but calculations  were not  completed
     (check end of the *.lst file) 
  f) EMPIRE crashed (see above)
  NOTE: PLOTC4 is obsolete, ZVView should be used instaed.

Q WHY SCRIPTS DO NOT RUN?

A Check whether you have the bash shell installed (e.g., type 'bash' at
  command prompt)

  NOTE: bash shell is available on most UNIX/LINUX boxes but usually not
  on those running MS Windows (unless Cygnus is being used). All
  FORTRAN sources in the EMPIRE package should run on any platform,
  but scripts will NOT!


Q GUI SHOWS UP BUT 'RUN' BUTTON DOES NOTHING?

A Most likely these are scripts that are not running properly. See above.
