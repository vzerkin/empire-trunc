\chapter{EMPIRE optional input keywords\label{InputList}}

%{\color{red} Rev.1, 18 August 2015}\newline
{\color{red} Rev.2, 31 August 2016}\newline
The optional input allows modifications to the default model parameters.
Optional input consists of an arbitrary number of records, entered in any order
and closed with the GO record, which indicates the end of the input.
In the simplest case (all defaults), only the GO record must be entered. \\

Each optional record starts with an alphanumeric keyword {\bf NAME}. If the first
character of the line (i.e. {\bf NAME(1:1)}) is {\bf *}, {\bf \#} or {\bf !}, then this
line contains comments and is ignored by the code. There might be an arbitrary number of
comments line in the optional input. If the first character of the line {\bf NAME(1:1)}
is {\bf @}, then this line contains a title, which will be printed in EMPIRE outputs;
obviously the title is not used in any calculations. Multiple titles are allowed.
Users are strongly encouraged to use titles and comments in EMPIRE inputs; that will be a
significant step toward a better documentation of our theoretical calculations
and evaluations.\\

The optional-input keyword {\bf NAME} is followed by the value VAL and four positional
parameters I1, I2, I3, I4. The keyword indicates a physical quantity, such as the
binding energy or level density parameter or scaling parameter.
VAL takes the numerical value  of the given quantity or scaling parameter.  \\
The  positional parameters are typically  used to  specify to which nucleus the quantity
should be applied (generally  if these are omitted  the value is applied to all
nuclei in the given calculation). Positional parameters may be also used to
indicate the estimated uncertainty of the quantity defined by the input keyword
(except optical model parameters for which the uncertainty is defined by VAL).
Each record must be in the FORTRAN format:\\
\begin{quote}
FORMAT (A6,G10.5,4I5) {\bf NAME},VAL,I1,I2,I3,I4
\end{quote}
%\\
Fixed format allows to avoid typing zeros if no input is needed for some
positional parameters.

The GO record indicates end of the optional input and starts calculations.
It may be followed by an unlimited list of incident energies (and titles or comments)
(one per record) terminated with a record containing a negative value.
Anything below this line will be ignored by the code.

\end{description}

\section*{Output control}

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm]
\item [{IOUT}] Main output control set to VAL
\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=1cm]
\item[= 1] input data and essential results (all cross sections) (default),
\item[= 2] as IOUT=1 plus fusion spin distribution, yrast state population,

 Angular values I1 and I2 are expected in degrees and should be less than 175 deg.
Default angles are 30 and 150 degrees.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Optical Model Potential }

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm]

\item [{OMPOT}] Selects optical model parameters for outgoing particle

        The value of I1 selects the outgoing particle as follows:
        =1 neutrons,
        =2 protons,
        =3 alphas,
        =4 deuterons,
        =5 tritons,
        =6 He-3;
        VAL must be set to a RIPL catalog number (e.g. 2408 for Capote et al OMP)
        of the potential as it appears in the empire/RIPL/optical/om-data/om-index.txt
        file or in Help $=>$ 'RIPL omp' when using GUI. For backward compatibility this
        number can be entered with a negative sign.

\item [{DIRPOT}] Optical model parameters to be used in DWBA or coupled-channels calculations by ECIS/OPTMAN codes. Parameters are the same as above, except that I1 need not be specified (always refers to the incident channel).

\item [{RELKIN}] Override the RIPL defined kinematics used in a given optical model potential,

       = 0 classical (default),

       = 1 relativistic.

\item [{TRGLEV}] Excited level of the target is set to VAL  (e.g., VAL=3 for the 2$^{nd}$ excited state; default: 1 (ground state)).

\item [{UOMPab}]
 Uncertainty of the parameters defining the potential strength
of the optical model potential. The letter a can be V (real potential strength) or W
(imaginary potential strength). The letter b can be V (volume) or S(surface).
Thus the combinations VV (real volume), WV (imaginary volume), and WS (imaginary surface)
specify 3 different terms in the RIPL optical potential described in Refs.~\cite{RIPL2,RIPL3}.
The combination VS is not allowed, as parameters of the real surface potential (VS) are usually
not used in deriving phenomenological potentials. The exception is for dispersive potentials, but
in this case the VS uncertainty is fully determined by the uncertainty of the imaginary surface
potential (WS). The uncertainty of the spin-orbit potential is also not considered as its influence on calculated
cross sections is small.\\
The relative uncertainty in \% of the corresponding parameter (defined by letters \emph{a} and \emph{b}) is given by VAL,
 target's  Z and  A numbers are defined by I1 and I2, respectively.
I3 defines the outgoing particle, i.e., the incident particle for the inverse reaction (I3=1 for
neutron, I3=2 for protons, etc). \\
Some examples of potential strength uncertainties are given below.
\begin{verbatim}
* The three lines below define 1.5% uncertainty of the real
* volume potential strength and 10% uncertainty of the real
* and imaginary surface potential strength for neutron and
* proton emission channels from the 56-Mn compound nucleus
UOMPVV   1.50000  25    55   1
UOMPWV  10.0000   25    55   1
UOMPWS  10.0000   25    55   1
* The same for the proton emission channel
UOMPVV   1.50000  24    55   2
UOMPWV   2.5000   24    55   2
UOMPWS  10.0000   24    55   2
\end{verbatim}


\item [{UOMPcd}] Defines the uncertainty of the geometry component of the optical model
potential. The letter c can be R (radius) or A (diffuseness). The letter d can be V (real volume),
W (imaginary volume) or S (imaginary surface). Thus the following six combinations are possible:
RV and AV (real volume radius and diffuseness), RW and AW (imaginary volume radius and diffuseness),
and RS and AS (surface radius and diffuseness). \\
The relative uncertainty of the corresponding parameter (defined by letters c and d) is given by VAL
(in percent),  target's  Z and  A are defined by I1 and I2, respectively.
I3 defines the outgoing particle, i.e. the incident particle for the inverse reaction (I3=1 for
neutron, I3=2 for protons, etc). \\
It is recommended to avoid variations of potential strength (e.g. VV,WV) and corresponding potential
radius (e.g. RV, RW) in the same run, as those parameters are strongly correlated within the optical
model.\\
Some examples of geometry uncertainties of the optical model parameters are given below.\\
\begin{verbatim}
* The two lines below define 1.5% uncertainty of the
* imaginary volume radius, and 2.5% uncertainty of the
* imaginary volume diffuseness for a neutrons incident
* on 55Mn nucleus
UOMPRW   1.50000  25    55   1
UOMPAW   2.5000   25    55   1
* The same for the proton emission channel
* corresponding to the surface potential.
UOMPRS   1.50000  24    55   2
UOMPAS   2.5000   24    55   2

\section*{Scattering on collective levels}
EMPIRE includes two coupled-channels codes: ECIS\index{ECIS} and
OPTMAN\cite{OPTMAN1,OPTMAN2,OPTMAN3}. ECIS is the default optical model solver,
but OPTMAN should be used for selected potentials, when soft-rotor
couplings are desired, as well as for actinide potentials that couple levels
beyond the ground state rotational band.

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm]
\item [{DIRECT}] Controls use of coupled-channel calculations (ECIS and OPTMAN)

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=1cm]

\item[=0] spherical OM used (default)

\item[=1] Coupled Channel (CC) method used for calculation of inelastic scattering
to collective levels in the incident channel.
If a selected OM potential is of CC type, the elastic and reaction cross
sections are also taken from ECIS/OPTMAN calculations.
Otherwise, spherical OM results are used. Transmission coefficients
for all outgoing channels are calculated with spherical OM.

\item[=2] as above but transmission coefficients for the inelastic outgoing
channels are calculated within Coupled Channel approach (longer calculation time).

\item[=3] as DIRECT=1 but DWBA\index{DWBA} is used instead of CC for calculation of
inelastic scattering to collective levels in the incident channel.
All transmission coefficients calculated with spherical OM.
\end{description}

NOTE: OM potential to be used by ECIS/OPTMAN might be different from the
one used in the rest of the calculations and can be specified with
the DIRPOT option.

\item [{CALCTL}] Controls use of calculated transmission coefficients for both
projectile and ejectiles.\\

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=1cm]

\item[= 0] Transmission coefficients calculated during the first run are stored, and reused
    in subsequent EMPIRE runs (default),

\item[$>0$] Transmission coefficients are calculated for each run even if they were calculated before and respective files  exist. This option is useful to calculate some quantities that are only used if TL are not already present (e.g. Bass fusion barrier in HI induced reactions).

    NOTE: this option slows down the execution of the code in subsequent runs by
    up to a factor of 10  (additional time is needed to calculate TLs again; reading
    them is much faster).
\end{description}

\item [{EcDWBA}] Automatically selects all discrete levels to be used in DWBA
calculations for uncoupled collective levels. \\
The default cut-off energy is $3*30/A^{2/3}$, and the default maximum spin 4.
With these defaults all levels ($J<5$) with excitation energy less than
2.4 MeV for $^{238}U$), and  less than 6.2 MeV for $^{56}Fe$ are considered.\\
The default selection rules could be modified by the VAL parameter that redefines
the cut-off energy, and the parameter I1 that sets the maximum spin.

\item [{RESOLF}] Energy resolution in MeV used to spread calculated collective
cross sections in the continuum set to VAL.\\
This parameter is used if there are collective levels (in the {*}-lev.col file)
that are located in the continuum (see the \emph{cont} flag). The scattering
cross sections on these levels will be calculated by DWBA (if keyword DIRECT $>0$).

\item [{DEFNUC}] Deformation of the target nucleus set to VAL.\\
The threshold value to assume that the nucleus is deformed is 0.1
If you want to force the assumption of sphericity for a given nucleus
you can use this parameter with a value less than 0.1
this parameter also affects the deformation used in MSD calculations.

\item [{ECONT}] The energy continuum for the nucleus with Z=I1 and A=I2
starts at energy given by VAL in MeV.\\
This parameter overwrites the continuum cut-off energy defined in the
default RIPL levels for a given nucleus (or even the value given in the
local LEVELS file). If not nucleus is given, then the value is ignored.

\end{description}

\section*{Scaling parameters correcting for model deficiencies}
These parameters are non-physical parameters designed to be used in nuclear data evaluation to correct for reaction model deficiencies, and to define model parameters' uncertainties.
They are also used for covariance calculations by providing a straightforward way to calculate sensitivities (required as input for KALMAN), and to allow for random sampling of model parameters within defined uncertainties (required for Monte Carlo generation of theoretical model covariances).


\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm]
\item [{TUNE}] The equilibrium decay width $\Gamma^{EQ}_i$ of the ejectile $i$ given by I3,
for the nucleus with Z=I1 and A=I2 will be multiplied by VAL.\\
Estimated relative uncertainty in \% of this parameter can be given by I4.

\item [{TUNEFI}] The fission decay width $\Gamma_F$ will be multiplied by VAL for the nucleus with Z=I1 and A=I2.\\
Estimated uncertainty of this parameter can be given by I3.

\item [{TUNEPE}] The preequilibrium decay width $\Gamma_i$ of the ejectile $i$
given by I1 will be multiplied by VAL. It applies only to the PE decay from the
compound nucleus calculated by PCROSS (exciton model), input keyword PCROSS $>0$. \\
Estimated relative uncertainty in \% of this parameter can be given by I2.

\item [{PFNNIU}] Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 The evaluated total prompt neutron multiplicity $\widetilde{\nu}$
                 (read from NUBAR-EVAL.ENDF) will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\

\item [{PFNTKE}] Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 The total kinetic energy (TKE) of the fission fragments
                 will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The TKE enters the energy balance equation defining the total excitation
                 energy of the fissioning system $U_{exc} = E_{rel} - TKE + E_{incid} + B_n$.
                 This parameter could be interpreted as the uncertainty of the measured
                 fission kinetic energy.\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.

\item [{PFNALP}] Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 The default parameter $\alpha$ ($\alpha_0=1$ for Madland-Nix (LA) model~\cite{Madland:82} and
                 $\alpha_0~0.9$ for Kornilov parameterization~\cite{Kornilov:99}) will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The values $E_f^L$ and $E_f^H$ of the average kinetic energy per nucleon
                 of the average light fragment AL and average heavy fragment AH are scaled
                 by $\alpha$. The effect of this parameter on PFNS calculations is strongly correlated
                 with TKE (see keyword PFNTKE above). //
                 Physically, this parameter allows for a reduction of the kinetic energy of the
                 fragment due to neutron emission during Coulomb acceleration.\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\

\item [{PFNRAT}] Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 The default parameter $r=T_f^L/T_f^H$ ($r_0=1$ for Madland-Nix (LA) model~\cite{Madland:82} and
                 $r_0=1.248$ for Kornilov parameterization~\cite{Kornilov:99}) will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 This parameter defines the ratio of temperatures of the light to heavy fragment.
                 Experimental evidence strongly supports ~20\% higher temperature of the light fragment.\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\

\item [{PFNERE}] Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 The total fission energy release ($E_{rel}$) will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The $E_{rel}$ enters the energy balance equation defining the total excitation
                 energy of the fissioning system $U_{exc} = E_{rel} - TKE + E_{incid} + B_n$.
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.

\item [{TMAXW}]  Used in prompt fission neutron (PFN) calculations.
                 PFNS plots are scaled by a Maxwellian function with T = VAL (default: 1.32) MeV.

\item [{DEFSTA}] The static deformation needed in rigid-rotor CC calculations
                 will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\
                 It is recommended not to vary dynamical deformation above 10 MeV
				 (i.e. set its uncertainty to zero) to avoid numerical instabilities.

\item [{DEFDYN}] Dynamical deformations of uncoupled levels for DWBA calculations will be
                 multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).\\
                 Dynamical deformations are listed for all collective levels in the collective
                 file ({*}-col.lev).\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\
                 It is recommended not to vary dynamical deformation above 10 MeV
				 (i.e. set its uncertainty to zero) to avoid numerical instabilities.

\item [{ELARED}] The shape elastic cross section will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The change is also reflected in the total cross section. \\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.

\item [{FUSRED}] The fusion (reaction) cross section will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.).
                 The change is also reflected in the total cross section. \\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.

\item [{FCCRED}] The calculated direct cross section for discrete collective levels will be multiplied
                 by VAL (default: 1.). Cross sections of both coupled and uncoupled discrete levels are
				 scaled. \\
                 The uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\
                 It has no effect if DIRECT keyword is set to zero in the input (default).

\item [{FCORED}] The DWBA calculated direct cross section for collective levels in the continuum will
                 be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.). Giant multipole resonances are also scaled
				 if specified in the collective level file (flagged with negative deformation). \\
                 The uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% could be given by I1.\\
                 It has no effect if DIRECT keyword is set to zero in the input (default).\\
				 A value of zero could be used to supress DWBA collective levels in the continuum,
				 without recalculating the transmission coefficients (TLs).

\item [{TOTRED}] The total cross section will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.). \\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% can be given by I1.\\
				 TOTRED is applied through other scaling factors, namely ELARED,FUSRED,FCCRED and FCORED.\\
				 If those factors are present, then the final scaling will be a product of them
				 (e.g., if both TOTRED and FUSRED are specified, then the fusion (reaction) cross section
				 will be multiplied by FUSRED*TOTRED.\\
This parameter is recommended to be used to correct small deficiencies (~3\%) of your optical model
calculated total cross sections. It is not recommended to be used for simulation of the experimental fluctuations
of total cross section.

\item [{CELRED}] The compound elastic cross section will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.). \\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% can be given by I1.\\
This parameter may be used to simulate the CN resonances (obviously not included in the optical model), or
to simulate physical effects arising from the compound-direct processes interference
(Engelbrecht-Weidenmuller transformation). The interference increases the compound inelastic cross sections,
reducing others compound channels (incl. the compound elastic). If you use CELRED and CINRED at the same energy
please note that some interference will result as they affect the same quantities.

\item [{CINRED}] The compound inelastic cross section to discrete levels will be multiplied by VAL (default: 1.). \\
                 The discrete level number can be given by I1.\\
                 The relative uncertainty of the scaling factor in \% can be given by I2.\\
This parameter may be used to simulate physical effects arising from the compound-direct processes interference
(Engelbrecht-Weidenmuller transformation). The interference increases the compound inelastic cross sections,
reducing others compound channels (incl. the compound elastic).

\item [{DXSRED}] The calculated deuteron pick-up/stripping cross section for incident deuteron
				 on the target nucleus will be multiplied by VAL).
                 It has no effect on other incident particles.

              \begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=1cm]
               \item[$>0$] deuteron pick-up/stripping parameterization of Kalbach used for incident deuterons (default: 1.),
               \item[$=0$] deuteron pick-up/stripping suppressed.
              \end{description}

\end{description}

\section*{Optical model fitting}

\begin{description}[style=multiline,leftmargin=3cm]
\item [{FITOMP}] Controls fitting of optical model potential in the incident channel,

by VAL for the nucleus with Z=I1 and A=I2. \\Uncertainty of the shell correction
value in \% may be given by I4 (default  1.0).\\
The default value corresponds to the use of RIPL Myers-Swiatecki shell corrections
assuming a negligible uncertainty.
\item [{JSTAB}] Rotation stability limit with respect to spin for the nucleus Z=I1
and A=I2,

= 0  spin at which fission barrier (incl. shell correction)
disappears (default),

$>0$ set to VAL.
